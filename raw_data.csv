1,1,2020-05-28 00:58:50,that is the new book by stephanie kelton and the subtitle is  modern monetary theory and the birth of the people is economy    here are a few observations 1  much of it is quite unobjectionable and well known  dating back to the bullionist debates or earlier yet   yet regularly it flies off the handle and makes unsupported macroeconomic assertions 2  like many of the austrians  kelton likes to insist on special terms  such as the government spending  coming first    you do not have to say this is wrong  just keep your eye on the ball and do not let it distract you 3   mmt has emphasized that rising interest income can serve as a potential form of fiscal stimulus    you do not have to believe in a naive form of say is law  but discussions of demand should start with the notion of production   then  never reason from an interest rate change    overall  i sense kelton has one core model of the macroeconomy  with a whole host of variables held fixed   well higher interest rates means printing up more money to pay for them and thus greater stimulus     and then applies that model to a whole series of quite general problems and questions 4  she thinks  demand  simply puts resources to work  and in this sense the book is a nice reductio ad absurdum of the economics one increasingly sees from mainstream writers on twitter   p s   the economy does not have a  speed limit    and it should not be modeled using analogies with buckets 5  we are told that the u s    cannot lose control of its interest rate   but real and nominal interest rates are not distinguished with care in these discussions   the fed is ability to control real rates is fairly limited  though not zero  and those are empirical truths never countered or even confronted in this book 6  the absence of a nominal budget constraint is confused repeatedly with the absence of a  real  budget constraint   that is one of the major errors in this book 7  it still would be very useful if the mmt people would take a mainstream macro model and spell out which assumptions they wish to make different  and then solve for the properties of the new model   there is a reason why they will not do that 8  i do not care what the author says or how canonical she is as a source  a federal jobs guarantee is not part of mmt 9  just because the economy is not at absolute full unemployment  it does not mean that free resources are on the table for the taking   again  in this regard kelton is a useful reductio on a lot of  twitter macro  10  i am plenty well read in the  money cranks  of earlier times  including soddy  foster  catchings  kitson  proudhon  tucker  and many more   they got a lot of things right  but they also failed to produce coherent macro theories   i would strongly recommend that kelton undertake a close study of their failings 11  for all the criticisms of the quantity theory  i would like to know how the mmt people explain the fed coming pretty close to its inflation rate target for many years in a row  under highly varying conditions  fiscal conditions too 12  the real grain of truth here is that if monetary policy is otherwise too deflationary  monetizing parts or all of the budget deficit is not only possible  it is desirable   absolutely  but do not then let somebody talk loops around you you can order the book  ,['amazon.com'],84,2020-05-28 01:09:33
2,1,2020-05-27 13:43:39,or a partial such allocation  at least   here is  the renowned economist erik brynjolfsson recently    at least so far  i have not seen any one suggesting to use the market system to allocate vaccines  not even those who strongly advocate it in other areas  why is that  as one of several people copied at the bottom of the tweet  i feel compelled to take up the challenge i readily admit that a significant portion of the vaccines  when they come  should be allocated by non market forces to health care workers   front line  workers  servicemen on aircraft carriers  and so on   yet still there is room for market allocation  especially since multiple vaccines are a real possibility if you had to choose among those vaccines  would not it make sense to look for guidance from market prices  they will reflect information about the perceived value of both protection and risk  on the same principle  if you need brain surgery  you would certainly want to know what the brain surgeon charges  although of course that should not be the only factor in your decision and the market prices for vaccines could be useful for other purposes as well  if scientific resources need to be allocated to improve vaccines or particular vaccine approaches  for instance  market prices might be useful signals note also that the scope of the market might expand over time  in the early days of vaccine distribution  health care workers will be a priority  eventually  however  most of them will have access to vaccines  selling off remaining vaccine doses might do more to encourage additional production than would bureaucratic allocation at a lower price say china gets a vaccine first   how about a vaccine vacation in a nearby asian locale  singapore  vietnam   for 30k   unless you think that should be illegal  you favor some form of a market in vaccines in any case  there is much more at the link   overall i found it striking how few people took up erik is challenge   whether or not you agree with my arguments  to me they do not seem like such a stretch ,"['bloomberg.com', 'twitter.com']",68,2020-05-27 13:47:37

5,1,2020-05-27 00:45:16,in one of the   anna stansbury and larry summers present what is to me the best non  great stagnation  story of what has gone wrong  and i have read many such accounts   here is their abstract rising profitability and market valuations of us businesses  sluggish wage growth and a declining labor share of income  and reduced unemployment and inflation  have defined the macroeconomic environment of the last generation  this paper offers a unified explanation for these phenomena based on reduced worker power  using individual  industry  and state level data  we demonstrate that measures of reduced worker power are associated with lower wage levels  higher profit shares  and reductions in measures of the nairu  we argue that the declining worker power hypothesis is more compelling as an explanation for observed changes than increases in firms  market power  both because it can simultaneously explain a falling labor share and a reduced nairu  and because it is more directly supported by the data there is a good deal of critical thinking about how different macroeconomic trends fit together  and a willingness to consider disconfirming evidence  so i do recommend you read through this one i have five main worries about the argument 1  rather than labor losing bargaining power  i think of the key development as  management measuring the marginal product of labor more precisely    admittedly that does lower the bargaining power of the majority of workers  given the 20 80 rule  or whatever you think the proper proportions are  stansbury and summers themselves presumably are underpaid  but in general wage dispersion has been going up in high skilled sectors  a minority of highly productive workers have  much more  bargaining power than they did before  which does not quite fit the  lower bargaining power per se  hypothesis   and under my interpretation  easier unionization may not be much of a solution  since the problem here is the actual reality of who produces what   consistent with my view  labor is share is  if you consider the super talented labor owners capitalists who start their own companies   that is a return to labor as well 2  it is a noted advantage of the stansbury and summers approach that is explains the now lower natural rate of unemployment   the puzzle  i think  is to explain both lower nairu  and  the slower labor market matching observed over the post 2009 labor market recovery   their hypothesis seems to predict a higher degree of worker desperation  and thus quicker matches  than what we actually observed if you think  as i do  that employers are now better aware of the diversity of worker quality  and that only ex post do they learn that quality  employers will be more careful upfront  which probably does slow down matching speeds  thus fitting the data better 3  if you play down market power  and postulate a fall in the share of labor  you might expect investment to be robust  but measured investment clocks in as mediocre   the authors discuss this point at length on pp 45 46 and offer multiple rebuttals  but i suppose i still think the first order effect here ought to be stronger than what we  seem to  observe 4  if corporate profits are so high  how is this consistent with the persistently low demand postulated by summers is  secular stagnation  hypothesis   the paper does consider this question very directly on p 56  but i genuinely  just as a matter of grammar  do not understand the answer the authors are suggesting   here goes a fair question about the labor rents hypothesis regards what it says about the secular stagnation hypothesis that one of us has put forward  summers 2013   we believe that the shift towards more corporate income that occurs as labor rents decline operates to raise saving and reduce demand  the impact on investment of reduced labor power seems to us ambiguous  with lower labor costs on the one hand encouraging expanded output and on the other encouraging more labor intensive production  as discussed in section v so decreases in labor power may operate to promote the reductions in demand and rising gap between private saving and investment that are defining features of secular stagnation i suppose i had thought of low rates of profit as a  though not the   defining feature of secular stagnation  but again i may not have understood this passage correctly 5  matt rognlie  the decline in labor is share went to housing and land ownership  not capital in any case  here is a whole paper full of economics  go and enjoy it ,"['nber.org', 'marginalrevolution.com', 'twitter.com']",51,2020-05-27 01:08:31

8,1,2020-05-26 02:08:08,i am not sure this could work  but everyone else is doing weird ideas  so let us consider another one remember  of education from 19th century england   part of the idea was to keep small group size  and economize on labor  by having the students teach each other  typically with the older students instructing the younger here is my suggestion  have students use an app to arrange in person meetings  in groups of five  for periods of a few weeks running   social distancing and masks can be applied as conditions at the time dictate   the app will match students on the basis of stated interests  and sometimes by other methods too  such as levels of mathematical sophistication or if you wish cultural diversity   the app also will tell them where to meet on campus   all classes being held outside  some classes would be led by professors  but there are not enough professors to go around so many others would be led by the more senior or otherwise better informed students   professors and tas could rotate across various groups if so needed all students are given free ipads  connected to campus wireless  and sometimes those ipads would serve as collective blackboards for the small groups central admin  or departments could impose curricular structure in advance  or within a topic area particular assignments might be generated by  unconference  methods  for instance the students might agree to read a particular book or essay  or to all learn a particular skill   to the extent overseeing faculty are scarce  you can try having the students themselves finding the relevant teaching materials   very good groups would have the option of continuing for further weeks start in august  keep on going until its gets too cold  they did it at valley forge and people learn in the desert and tropics too   many of the meetings can be short   say 45 minutes   and you can privilege the more valuable majors with locations in the shade   put up as many tents as you can every class has a supply of back up youtube material  and associated testing  for when the weather is bad  or for when the semester has to end for the final semester grade each student writes a 20 25 pp  paper about what he or she learned through these units   professors and sometimes tas would grade those papers  and do note this is not an insuperable grading burden   it rewards the  did you learn anything useful at all   approach  rather than  did you manage to sit and suffer through through all of your boring classes   i suspect it feels too much like chaos to a university administrator  but perhaps that is an argument in its favor you will note that this method  for all of its learning uncertainties  has two big advantages   first  it really does prioritize the health of everyone involved   second  students still have lots of contact with each other and get to enjoy some version of the campus experience   the interactive groups might even provide a more engaging campus experience than did the status quo ex ante  keeping in mind that some schools will combine this method with the abolition or radical paring down of dorms  addendum   hand out free diapers  all other plans have that issue too ,['constitution.org'],92,2020-05-26 02:28:46

66,1,2020-05-15 00:10:15,let us say its 1990  and you are proposing an ambitious privatization plan to an eastern bloc county  and your plan assumes that the enacting government is able to stay on a non corrupt path the entire time while your plan probably is better than communism  it probably is not a very good plan   a better plan would take sustainability and political realities into account  and indeed many societies did come up with better plans  for instance the poland plan was better than the russia plan it would not do to announce  i am just an economist  i do not do politics    in fact that attitude is fine  but if you hold it you should not be presenting plans to the central government or discussing your plan on tv   there are plenty of other useful things for you to do   or the uni disciplinary approach still might be a useful academic contribution  but still displaced and to be kept away from the hands of decision makers nor would it do to claim  i am just an economist   the politicians have to figure the rest out    they cannot figure the rest out in most cases   either stand by your proposed plan or do not do it   it is indeed a proposal of some sort  even if you package it with some phony distancing language instead  you should try to blend together the needed disciplines as best you can  consulting others when necessary  an offer the best plan you can  namely  the best plan all things considered  that might fill you with horror  but please recall from tetlock that  usually the generalists are the best predictors  ignoring other disciplines may be fine when there is no interaction  when estimating the effects of monetary policy  you probably can do that without calculating how many people that year will die of air pollution   but you probably should not ignore the effects of a major trade war  a budgetary crisis   but i do monetary policy  not fiscal policy     or an asteroid hurtling toward the earth if that is too hard  it is fine to  announce your final opinion as agnostic   and explain how you got there    you will note that when it comes to blending economics and epidemiology   this is all well known  and it has been largely accepted for some time now if a public health person presents what is  only an estimate of public health and public health alone  to policymakers  i view it as like the economist in 1990 who will not consider politics   someone else should have the job   right now public health  politics  and economics all interact to a significant extent and if you present only one of those disciplines to a policymaker  you will likely confuse and mislead that policymaker  because he she cannot do the required backward unthreading of the advice into its uni dimensional component   you have simply served up a biased model  and rather than trying to identify and explain the bias you are simply saying  ask someone else about the bias  if an economist claims he is only doing macroeconomics  and not epidemiology  as paul krugman has said a few times on twitter   that is flat out wrong   all current macro models have epidemiology embedded in them  if only because the size of the negative productivity and negative demand shock depends all too critically on the course of the disease it is fine to be agnostic  preferably with structure to the opinion   it is wrong to hide behind the arbitrary division of a discipline or a field we need the best estimates possible  and presented to policymakers as such  and embodying the best of synthetic human knowledge   of course that is hard   that is why we need the very best people to do it  addendum   you might try to defend a uni disciplinary approach by arguing a decision maker will mainly be fed other  biased uni disciplinary approaches  and you have to get your discipline into the mix to avoid obliteration of its viewpoint   but let us be clear what is going on here  you are deliberately manipulating with a deliberately non truthy approach  i intend those words as a description  not a condemnation    if that is what it is  i wish to describe it that way   i will also note i have never done that deliberately myself  and that is along many years of advising at a variety of levels   i would rather give the best truthful account as i see it ,['marginalrevolution.com'],120,2020-05-15 00:20:10

107,1,2020-05-06 13:53:18,tinges of covid 19  doses on financial crises  but mostly about economic history   here is    here is the summary adam joined tyler to discuss the historically unusual decision to have a high cost lockdown during a pandemic  why he believes in a swoosh shaped recovery  portents of financial crises in china and the west  which emerging economies are currently most at risk  what keynes got wrong about the treaty of versailles  why the weimar republic failed  whether hitler was a keynesian  the political and economic prospects of various eu members  his trick to writing a lot  how twitter encourages him to read more  what he taught executives at bp  his advice for visiting germany  and more here is one excerpt  cowen     was it as bad as keynes said  tooze   no  i am a confirmed liberal keynesian in my broad politics  and my understanding of politics and the way expertise ought to relate to it  and the operations of modern democracy  i think his political writings in  are brilliant  but i regard  as disastrous because  essentially  it enhanced and gave arguments to the german nationalists who   cowen   but that does not mean keynes was wrong  right  it may have had that effect  but he is writing at a time where the wealth to income ratio is especially low  so a given measure of debt burden is much worse for an economy than what  we  might be used to  tooze   absolutely  but the evidence of the 1920s is that  with the right framework  the weimar republic was  in fact  perfectly capable of bearing a reasonable burden of reparations   2 percent to 3 percent were doable  the fact of the matter is the german political class had no interest in accepting that responsibility and was quite determined to do a variety of different things to escape that burden and there is no doubt at all that the front loading of the demands  which is very understandable from the point of view of the financial needs of the french in particular  caused a huge bottleneck  if you like  early on in the history of the weimar republic when it was most fragile  and  that is   as it were  the moment when i think the critique is most valid and that is why  for me  really  the hidden agenda of the economic consequences of the peace is an appeal  to the brits but above all to the americans  for large scale debt concessions  on which one could only agree with keynes that this was  in fact  absolutely critical  that market economies have unspoken fundamental political preconditions  which  in the aftermath of the massive war  have been disrupted and  cowen   speaking of hitler  was hitler  in fact  the keynesian  tooze   no  hitler personally   absolutely not  hitler is personal monetary ideas are very  very conservative  he is an anti inflation hawk  he has to be persuaded to engage in large scale monetary financing somebody like  is a contemporary of keynes  and that is hitler central banker and an adventurous monetary thinker  he would learned to think outside the monetary box  if you like  in the efforts to stabilize weimar is currency in 1923 24  and he is certainly an expansionary  he is not afraid of monetary finance and of using off balance sheet vehicles to provide liquidity and to provide credit for an underemployed economy and quite reasonably  no one is worried about inflation in 1933 because germany has massive unemployment  so  in that sense  they are adventurous  macroeconomic  monetary economists they are not keynesians for the simple reasons that keynesianism  classically  of course   is  a liberal economic politics  it believes in a multiplier  and the multiplier is the be all and end all really of keynesian economics because what it suggests is that small  intermittent  discretionary interventions by the state   relatively small   will generate outside reactions from the economy  which will enable the state to serve a very positive role in stabilizing the economy but does not require the state to permanently intrude and take  over  the economy that is a post 1945 kind of vision of a mixed economy  keynes himself   that is why he wants the multiplier to be three because if the multiplier is three  then  1 by government spending generates  3 of private economic activity you can think of government intervention as sporadic  it is emergency medicine  it is not chronic care  that  of course  is the antithesis of what the nazis are doing because they are ramping up government spending  not across the board  but highly focused on rearmament because what they are doing is not just creating jobs  though they  do  create jobs as a side effect  what they are doing is restructuring the economy towards building the foundation for rearmament in a war economy what they are actually trying to do is systematically repress the multiplier because they do not want people employed in armaments factories to go out and buy clothing and fancy food  which requires imports  they want the money to be circled straight back into the armaments effort  saving various types of financial oppression is the order of the day  they are macroeconomists  the nazis  they are adventurous macroeconomists  they are doing massive intervention  but they are not keynesian tooze is discussion of his own career and interests  toward the end  is hard to excerpt but for me the highlight of the conversation   he also provided the best defense of twitter i have heard definitely recommended ,"['medium.com', 'history.com', 'palgrave.com', 'en.wikipedia.org', 'britannica.com']",80,2020-05-06 14:10:42

  highway to sfo had more police presence than usual  
  i took a morning flight out of the airport  and driving though the airport roads to get to the right terminal felt quite eerie  perhaps only saw one or two cars the whole time until we got to the terminal  and even then  i did not see more than three cars in front of each terminal dropping off passengers  
  i saw maybe 20 people  including employees  total in the terminal pre tsa check  only two travelers were not wearing masks  and none wore gloves  every employee was wearing a mask  and almost all  if not all  were wearing gloves  none of them 
  6 feet apart reminder stickers are everywhere  including on seats  
  tsa forced distancing during security check  though not if you were traveling with other people  
   all tsa employees were wearing masks and nitrile gloves  
  electric walkways were shut off to  conserve energy  
  i saw about 150 people  travelers  airport employees  airline employees and shop employees  on my way to the gate from security check  i would say 5 7  were not wearing masks  of the three pilots i saw  none were wearing masks or gloves   a lot more people than usual had paper tickets  which leads me to believe that they were all leaving sf for at least a few weeks  if not a few months  i checked my bag and was given a paper ticket even though i had the qr code on my phone   this is interesting economically given   and i know a lot of people who are breaking their leases and going to live with parents or someplace cheap like nevada or oregon  
  i boarded a 777 200 via united  i normally fly southwest  but i think they are not doing coast to coast flights on weekends for the foreseeable future  i think almost everyone on the plane had their own row  anyone who was sitting in the aisle was asked to move at least one seat over to allow some distancing while people walk back and forth on the plane  
  all of the flight attendants were wearing masks  
  the usual safety demonstration was conducted  but the flight attendants held up and pointed to the section in the safety card while the pilot was speaking  instead of using the life vest like normal  i suppose it was because the airline did not want them to take off their masks to demonstrate blowing into the tube of the life jacket  
  prepackaged drinks and snacks only  they gave everyone two small water bottles  an additional choice of drink  only water and various juices   and three snacks   like i said  i usually fly southwest and cannot remember the last time i flew united  this particular detail may or may not be relevant   _ ツ _    
  everyone had the option of a blanket  they normally do not wash these very often  so i wonder if covid forced them to wash it after every use

199,1,2020-04-20 12:12:29,this is from my email  highly recommended  and i will not apply further indentation  although there is a lot of pre peer reviewed and strongly incorrect work out there  i will single out kevin systrom is  as being deeply problematic  estimating r from noisy real world data when you do not know the underlying model is fundamentally difficult  but a minimal baseline capability is to get sign r 1  right  at least when  r 1  is not small   and rt live is going to often be badly  and confidently  wrong about that because it fails to account for how the confirmed count data it is based on is noisy enough to be mostly garbage   many serious modelers have given up on case counts and just model death counts   for an obvious example  consider their graph for wa  it is deeply implausible on its face that wa had r  24 on 10 april and r 1 4 on 17 april   in an epidemiological model with fixed waiting times  the implication would be that infectious people started interacting with non infectious people five times as often over the course of a week with no policy changes   digging into the data and the math  you can see that a few days of falling case counts will make the system confident of a very low r  and a few days of rising counts will make it confident of a very high one  but we know from other sources that both can and do happen due to changes in test and test processing availability   there are additional serious methodological problems with rt live  but trying to nowcast r from observed case counts is already garbage in so will be garbage out  however  folks are  understandably  given the difficulty and the rush  missing a lot of harder stuff too  you  and wrote  good and extensive west coast kaiser data set  and further evidence that r does not fall nearly as much as you might wish for   we read the study tonight  and the data set seems great and important  but we do not buy the claims about r at all   we think there are major statistical issues   i could go into it if you want  although it is fairly subtle  and of course there is some chance that  we are  wrong  ultimately  the models and statistics in the field are not designed to handle rapidly changing r  and everything is made much worse by the massive inconsistencies in the observed data  r itself is a surprisingly subtle concept  especially in changing systems   for instance  rt live uses a simple relationship between r and the observed rate of growth  but their claimed relationship only holds for the simplest sir model  not epidemiologically plausible at all for covid 19   and it has as an input the median serial interval  which is also substantially uncertain for covid 19  they treat it as a known constant   these things make it easy to badly missestimate r  usually these errors pull or push r away from 1   rt live would at least get sign r   1  right if their data were not garbage and they fixed other statistical problems   but of course getting sign r   1  right is a low bar  it is just figuring out whether what you are observing is growing or shrinking  many folks would actually be better off not trying to forecast r and just looking carefully at whether they believe the thing they are observing is growing or shrinking and how quickly all that said  the growing  not total  but mostly shared  consensus among both folks i have talked to inside google and with academic epidemiologists who are thinking hard about this is anyways  i guess my single biggest point is that if you see a result that says something about r  there is a very good chance it is just mathematically broken or observationally broken and is not actually saying that thing at all  that is all from rif a  saurous  research director at google  currently working on covid 19 modeling currently it seems to me that those are the smartest and best informed views  out there   so at least for now they are my views too ,"['secure-web.cisco.com', 'secure-web.cisco.com']",149,2020-04-20 12:17:12

208,1,2020-04-19 00:16:33,from my email box  here are perspectives from people in the world of epidemiology  the first being from jacob oppenheim i would note that epidemiology is the field that has most embraced novel and principles driven approaches to causal inference  eg those of judea pearl etc    pearl is cluster is at ucla  there is one at berkeley  and another at harvard the one at harvard simultaneously developed causal methodologies in the  70s  eg around rubin   then a parallel approach to pearl in the  80s  james robins and others   leading to a large collection of important epi people at hsph  miguel hernan  etc    many of these methods are barely touched in economics  which is unfortunate given their power in causal inference in medicine  disease  and environmental health these methods and scientists are very influential not only in public health   traditional epi  but throughout the biopharma and machine learning worlds   certainly  in my day job running data science   ml in biotech  many of us would consider well trained epidemiologists from these top schools among the best in the world for quantitative modeling  especially where causality is involved from julien sl i am not an epidemiologist per se  but i think my background gives me some inputs into that discussion  i have a master in mechatronics robotics engineering  a master in management science  and an mba  however  in the last ten years  epidemiology  and epidemiology forecasting  has figured heavily in my work as a consultant for the pharma industry  some data on most of epidemiology not being about pandemic forecasting  the result of the neglect of pandemics epidemiology is that there is precious little expertise in pandemics forecasting and prevention  the fir model  and it is variants  that we see a lot these days is a good teaching aid  still  it is not practically useful  you cannot fit exponentials with unstable or noisy parameters and expect good predictions  the only way to use r0 is qualitatively  when i saw the first r0 and mortality estimates back in january  i thought  this is going to be bad   then sold my liquid assets  bought gold  and naked puts on indices  i confess that i did not expect it to be quite as bad as what actually happened  or i would have bought more put options  here are a few tentative answers about your  rude questions  a  as a class of scientists  how much are epidemiologists paid   is good or bad news better for their salaries glassdoor data show that epidemiologists in the us are paid  63 911 on average  cdc and fda both pay better   98k and  120k   as well as pharma  merck   94k  115k   as explained above  most are working on cancer  diabetes  etc  so i am not sure what  bad news  would be for them b  how smart are they   what are their average gre scores i am not sure where you could get data to answer that question  i know that in pharma  many    maybe most   people who work on epidemiology forecasting do not have an epidemiology degree  they can have any type of stem degree  including engineering  economics  etc  so my base rate answer would be average of all stem gre scores    tc   here are   c  are they hired into thick  liquid academic and institutional markets   and how meritocratic are those markets compared to who  epidemiology is a smaller community than economics  so you should find less liquidity  pharma companies are heavily clustered into few geographies  new jersey  basel in switzerland  cambridge in the uk  etc   so private sector jobs are not an option for many epidemiologists d  what is their overall track record on predictions  whether before or during this crisis cdc has been running flu forecasting challenges every year for years  from what i have seen  the models perform reasonably well  it should be noted that those models would seem very familiar to an econometric forecaster  the same time series tools are used in both disciplines    tc   to be clear  i meant prediction of new pandemics and how they unfold e  on average  what is the political orientation of epidemiologists   and compared to other academics   which social welfare function do they use when they make non trivial recommendations hard to say  academics lean left  but medical doctors and other healthcare professionals often lean right  there is a conservative bias to medicine  maybe due to the  primo  non nocere  imperative  we see that bias at play in the hydroxychloroquine debate  most health authorities are reluctant to push   or even allow   a treatment option before they see overwhelming positive proof  even when the emergency should encourage faster decision making  g  how well do they understand how to model uncertainty of forecasts  relative to say what a top econometrician would know i have seen a similar pattern with the adoption of agent based models  common in epidemiology  marginal in economics   maybe epidemiologists are faster to take up new tools than economists  which maybe also give a hint about point e  h  are there  zombie epidemiologists  in the manner that paul krugman charges there are  zombie economists    if so  what do you have to do to earn that designation   and are the zombies sometimes right  or right on some issues   how meta rational are those who allege zombie ism i do not think so  epidemiology seems less political than economy  there are no equivalents to smith  karl marx  hayek  etc i  how many of them have studied philip tetlock is work on forecasting probably not many  given that their focus is not forecasting  conversely  i do not think that tetlock has paid much attention to epidemiology  on the good judgement website  healthcare questions of any type are very rare and here is  ruben conner  weighing in on your recent questions about epidemiologists  i did my undergraduate in economics and then went on for my masters in public health  both at university of washington   i worked as an epidemiologist for doctors without borders and now work as a consultant at the world bank  a place mostly run by economists   i have had a chance to move between the worlds and i see a few key differences between economists and epidemiologists  trust in data   like the previous poster said  epidemiologists recognize that  data is limited and often inaccurate   this is really drilled into the epidemiologist training   initial data collection can have various problems and surveys are not always representative of the whole population  epidemiologists worry about genuine errors in the underlying data  economists seem to think more about model bias  focus on implementation   epidemiologists expect to be part of the response and to deal with organizing data as it comes in  this is not a glamorous process  in addition  the government response can be well executed or poorly run and epidemiologists like to be involved in these details of planning  the knowledge here is practical and hands on   epidemiologists probably could do with more training on organizational management  they are not always great at this   belief in models   epidemiologists tend to be skeptical of fancy models  this could be because they have less advanced quantitative training  but it could also be because they do not have total faith in the underlying data  as noted above  and therefore see fancy specifications as more likely to obscure the truth than reveal it   economists often seem to want to fit the data to a particular theory   my impression is that they like thinking in the abstract and applying known theories to their observations as with most fields  i think both sides have something to learn from each other  there will be a need to work together as we weigh the economic impacts of suppression strategies  this is particularly crucial in low income places like india  where the disease suppression strategies will be tremendously costly for people is daily existence and ability to earn a living here is  on earlier spats between economists and epidemiologists   here is  and here is from an email from epidemiologist dylan green so with that on to the modelers  i will merely point out a few important details on modeling which i have not seen in response to you yet  first  the urgency with which policy makers are asking for information is tremendous  i have been asked to generate modeling results in a matter of weeks  in a disease which i we know very little about  which i previously would have done over the course of several months  with structured input and validation from collaborators on a disease i have studied for a decade  this ultimately leads to simpler rather than more complicated efforts  as well as difficult decisions in assumptions and parameterization  we do not have the luxury of waiting for better information or improvements in design  even if it takes a matter of days another complicated detail is the publicity of covid 19 projections  in other arenas  hiv  tb  malaria  model results are generated all the time  from hundreds of research groups  and probably  1  of the population will ever see these figures  modeling and governance of models of these diseases is advanced  there are well organized consortia who regularly meet to present and compare findings  critically appraise methods  elegantly present uncertainty  and have deep insights into policy implications  in hiv for example  models are routinely parameterized to predict policy impact  and are ex post validated against empirical findings to determine the best performing models  none of this is currently in scope for covid 19  unfortunately   as policy makers often want a single number  not a range  and they want it immediately i hope for all of our sakes we will see the modeling coordination efforts in covid 19 improve  and i ask my fellow epidemiologists to stay humble during this pandemic  for those with little specialty in communicable disease  it is okay to say  this is not my area of expertise and i do not have the answers   i think there has been too much hubris in the  i told ya so  from people who  said this would happen   or in knowing the obvious optimal policy  this disease continues to surprise us  and we are learning every day  we must be careful in how we communicate our certainty to policy makers and the public  lest we lose their trust when we are inevitably wrong  i suspect this is something that economists can likely teach us from experience one british epidemiologist wrote me and told me they are basically all socialists in the literal sense

227,1,2020-04-16 00:22:33,under swiss law  every resident is required to purchase health insurance from one of several non profit providers  those on low incomes receive a subsidy for the cost of cover  as early as march 4  the federal health office announced that the cost of the test   chf 180   189    would be reimbursed for all policyholders here is   that reimbursement is about 4x where u s  levels had been   the semi good news is that the  the u s  government will nearly double the amount it pays hospitals and medical centers to run   large scale coronavirus tests  an incentive to get the facilities to hire more technicians and expand testing that has fallen significantly short of the machines  potential abbott is m2000 machines  which can process  1 million tests per week  have not been fully used because not enough technicians have been hired to run them  according to a person familiar with the matter in other words  we have policymakers who do not know that supply curves slope upwards  who ever might have taught them that   the same person who sent me that swiss link also sends along this advice  which i will not further indent  as you know  there are 3 main venues for diagnostic tests in the u s   which are 1        centralized labs  dominated by quest and labcorp2        labs at hospitals and large clinics3        point of care teststhere is also the cdc  although my understanding is that its testing capacity is very limited   there may be reliability issues with poc tests  because apparently the most accurate test is derived from sticking a cotton swab far down in a patient is nasal cavity   so i think this leaves centralized labs and hospital labs   centralized labs perform lots of diagnostic tests in the u s  and my understanding is this occurs because of their inherent lower costs structures compared to hospital labs   hospital labs  could  conduct many diagnostic tests  but they choose not to because of their higher costs in this context  my assumption is that the relatively poor cms reimbursement of covid 19 tests of around  40 per test  means that only the centralized labs are able to test at volume and not lose money in the process   even in the case of centralized labs  they may have issues  because i do not think they are set up to test deadly infection diseases at volume   i am guessing you read the ny times article on new jersey testing yesterday  and that made me aware that patients often sneeze when the cotton swab is inserted in their noses   thus  it may be difficult to extract samples from suspected covid 19 patients in a typical lab setting   this can be diligence easily by visiting a quest or labcorp facility   thus  additional cost may be required to set up the infrastructure  e g   testing tents in the parking lot   to perform the sample extraction thus  if i were testing czar  which i obviously am not  i would recommend the following steps to substantially ramp up u s  testing 1        perform a rough and rapid diligence process lasting 2 or 3 days to validate the assumptions above and the approach described below  and specifically the  200 reimbursement number  see below    importantly  estimate the amount of unused covid 19 testing capacity that currently exists in u s  hospitals  but is not being used because of a shortage of kits reagents and because of low reimbursement   this number could be very low  very high or anywhere in between   i suspect it is high to very high  but i am not sure 2        increase cms reimbursement per covid 19 tests from about  40 to about  200   explain to whomever is necessary to convince  cms  congress    why this dramatic increase is necessary  i e   to offset higher costs for reagents  etc  and to fund necessary improvements in testing infrastructure  facilities and personnel   explain that this increase is necessary so hospital labs to ramp up testing  and not lose money in the process   explain how  200 is similar to what some other countries are paying  e g   switzerland at  189 3        make this higher reimbursement temporary  but through june 30  2020  hopefully testing expands by then  and whatever parties bring on additional testing by then have recouped their fixed costs 4        if necessary  justify the math  i e    200 per test  multiplied by roughly 1 or 2 million tests per day  roughly the target  x 75 days equals  15 to  30 billion  which is probably a bargain in the circumstances 5        work with the centralized labs  e g   quest  labcorp   etc    hospitals and healthcare clinics and manufactures of testing equipment and reagents  e g   thermofisher  roche  abbott  etc   to hopefully accelerate the testing process 6        try to get other payors  e g   hmos  ppos  etc   to follow

249,1,2020-04-12 00:41:50,i have had fringe contact with more epidemiology than usual as of late  for obvious reasons  and i do understand this is only one corner of the discipline   i do not mean this as a complaint dump  because most of economics suffers from similar problems  but here are a few limitations i see in the mainline epidemiological models put before us 1  they do not sufficiently grasp that  long run elasticities of adjustment are more powerful than short run elasticites    in the short run you socially distance  but in the long run you learn which methods of social distance protect you the most   or you move from doing  half home delivery of food  to  full home delivery of food  once you get that extra credit card or learn the best sites   in this regard the epidemiological models end up being too pessimistic  and it seems that  the natural disaster economist complaints about the epidemiologists   yes there is such a thing  are largely correct on this count   on this question economic models really do better  though not the  2  they do not sufficiently incorporate  public choice considerations    an epidemic path  for instance  may be   which leads to adjustments along the way  and very often those adjustments are stupid policy moves from impatient politicians   this is not built into the models i am seeing  nor are such factors built into most economic macro models  even though there is a large independent branch of public choice research   it is hard to integrate   still  it means that epidemiological models will be too optimistic  rather than too pessimistic as in  1   epidemiologists might protest that it is not the purpose of their science or models to incorporate politics  but these factors are relevant for prediction  and if you try to wash your hands of them  no pun intended  you will be wrong a lot 3   the lucas critique   namely that agents within a model  knowing the model  will change how the model itself operates   epidemiologists seem  super aware  of this  much more than keynesian macroeconomists are these days  though it seems to be more of a  i  told  you that you should listen to us  embodiment than trying to find an actual closed loop solution for the model as a whole   that is really hard  either in macroeconomics or epidemiology   still  on the predictive front without a good instantiation of the lucas critique again a lot will go askew  as indeed it does in economics the epidemiological models also do not seem to incorporate sam peltzman like risk offset effects   if you tell everyone to wear a mask  great   but people will feel safer as a result  and end up going out more   some of the initial safety gains are given back through the subsequent behavioral adjustment   epidemiologists might claim these factors already are incorporated in the variables they are measuring  but they are not constant across all possible methods of safety improvement   ideally you may wish to make people safer in a not entirely transparent manner  so that they do not respond with greater recklessness   i have not yet seen a straussian dimension in the models  though you might argue many epidemiologists are  naive straussian  in their public rhetoric  saying what is good for us rather than telling the whole truth   the straussian economists are slightly subtler 4   selection bias from the failures coming first    the early models were calibrated from wuhan data  because what else could they do   then came northern italy  which was also a mess   it is the messes which are visible first  at least on average   so some of the models may have been too pessimistic at first   these days we have germany  australia  and a bunch of southern states that have not quite  blown up  as quickly as they should have   if the early models had access to all of that data  presumably they would be more predictive of the entire situation today   but it is no accident that the failures will be more visible early on and note that right now some of the very worst countries  mexico  brazil  possibly india   are not far enough along on the data side to yield useful inputs into the models   so currently those models might be picking up too many semi positive data points and not enough from the  train wrecks   and thus they are too optimistic on this list  i think my  1 comes closest to being an actual criticism  the other points are more like observations about doing science in a messy  imperfect world   in any case  when epidemiological models are brandished  keep these limitations in mind   but the more important point may be for when critics of epidemiological models raise the limitations of those models   very often the cited criticisms are chosen selectively  to support some particular agenda  when in fact the biases in the epidemiological models could run in either an optimistic or pessimistic direction which is how it should be now  to close  i have a few rude questions that nobody else seems willing to ask  and i genuinely do not know the answers to these a  as a class of scientists  how much are epidemiologists paid   is good or bad news better for their salaries b  how smart are they   what are their average gre scores c  are they hired into thick  liquid academic and institutional markets   and how meritocratic are those markets d  what is their overall track record on predictions  whether before or during this crisis e  on average  what is the political orientation of epidemiologists   and compared to other academics   which social welfare function do they use when they make non trivial recommendations f  we know  from economics  that if you are a french economist  being a frenchman predicts your political views better than does being an economist  there is an old  mr  post on this somewhere    is there a comparable phenomenon in epidemiology g  how well do they understand how to model uncertainty of forecasts  relative to say what a top econometrician would know h  are there  zombie epidemiologists  in the manner that paul krugman charges there are  zombie economists    if so  what do you have to do to earn that designation   and are the zombies sometimes right  or right on some issues   how meta rational are those who allege zombie ism i  how many of them have studied philip tetlock is work on forecasting just to be clear  as  mr

286,1,2020-04-06 00:59:05,robin hanson makes   here is one excerpt so the scenario is this  hero hotels welcome sufficiently young and healthy volunteers  friends and family can enter together  and remain together  a cohort enters together  and is briefly isolated individually for as long as it takes to verify that they have been infected with a very small dose of the virus  they can then interact freely with each other  those those that show symptoms are isolated more  they cannot leave until tests show they have recovered in a hero hotel  volunteers have a room  food  internet connection  and full medical care  depending on available funding from government or philanthropic sources  volunteers might either pay to enter  get everything for free  or be paid a bonus to enter  health plans of volunteers may even contribute to the expense do read the whole thing   by the way     alex  by the way     here are my worries 1  qualified medical personnel are remarkably scarce right now   i do not see how it is possible to oversee the variolation of more than a small number of individuals   furthermore  it is possible that many medical personnel would refuse to oversee the practice   the net result would be only a small impact on herd immunity   if you doubt this  just consider how bad a job we americans have done scaling up testing and making masks the real question right now is  what can you do that is scalable    this is not it i recall robin writing on twitter that variolation would economize on the number of medical personnel   i think it would take many months for that effect to kick in  or possibly many years 2  where will we put all of the covid positive  contagious individuals we create   what network will we use to monitor their behavior   we have nothing close to the test and trace systems of singapore and south korea in essence  we would have to send them home to infect their families  the lombardy solution  or lock them up in provisional camps   who feeds and takes care of them in those camps  and what prevents those individuals from becoming infected   what is the penalty for trying to leave such a camp   is our current penal system  or for that matter our current military   both longstanding institutions with plenty of experienced personnel   doing an even ok job of overseeing covid positive individuals in their midst   i think not under the coercive approach  what is the exact legal basis for this detention   that a 19 year old signed a detention contract   is that supposed to be binding on the will in the rousseauian sense   where are the governmental structures to oversee and coordinate all of this   should we be trusting the cdc to do it   will any private institutions do it without complete governmental cover   i do not think so if all this is all voluntary  the version that robin himself seems to favor  what percentage of individuals will simply leave in the middle of their treatment   robin talks of  hero hotels   but which actual hotels will accept the implied liability   there is no magic valve out there to relieve the pressure on actual health care systems   note that the purely voluntary version of robin is plan can be done right now  but does it seem so popular   is anyone demanding it  any company wishing it could do it for its workforce 3  the nba has an amazing amount of money  on staff doctors  the ability to afford tests  and so on   and with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars at stake they still will not restart a crowdless  tv only season   they could indeed run a  heroes hotel  for players who got infected from training and play  and yet they will not    stadium and locker room as heroes hotel  is failing the market test   similarly  colleges and universities have a lot at stake  but they are not rushing to volunteer their dorms for this purpose  even if it might boost their tuition revenue if it went as planned  which is not my prediction  to be clear  the proposal requires institutions to implement it  yet it does not seem suited for any actual institution we have today 4  does small marginal amounts of variolation do much good compared to simply a weaker lockdown enforcement for activities that involve the young disproportionately   just tell the local police not to crack down on those soccer games out in the park   nb   i am  not  recommending this  rather it is the more practical version of what robin is recommending  both in my view are bad ideas    robin is idea has the  heroes hotel  attached  but that is a deus ex machina that simply assumes a  free space   both a literal free space and a legally free space  is available for experimentation  which it is not 5  society can only absorb a small number of very blunt messages from its leaders   you cannot have the president saying  this is terrible and you all must hide  and  we are going to expose our young  and expect any kind of coherent response   people are already confused enough from mixed messages from leaders such as presidents and governors 6  there is still a chance that covid 19 causes or induces permanent damage  perhaps to the heart and perhaps in the young as well   that does not militate in favor of increasing the number of exposures now  especially since partial protective measures  e g   antivirals  antibodies  might arise before a vaccine does   this residual risk  even if fairly small  also makes the liability issues harder to solve 7  the actual future of the idea is that as lockdown drags on  many individuals deliberately will become less careful  hoping to get their infections over with   a few may even infect themselves on purpose  one hopes with a proper understanding of dosage   one can expect this practice will be more popular with the  non obese  young   the question is then how to take care of those people and how to treat them   that debate will devolve rather rapidly into current discussions of testing  test and trace  self isolation  antivirals  triage  and so on   and then it will be seen that variolation is not so much of a distinct alternative as right now it seems to be 8  the main benefit of variolation proposals is to raise issues about the rates at which people get infected  and the sequencing of who is and indeed should be more likely to get infected first   those questions deserve much more consideration than they are receiving  and in that sense i am very happy to see variolation being brought  not much risk of it happening as an explicit proposal    that said  i do not think heroes hotel  and accelerating the rate of deliberate  publicly intended infection  is the way to a better solution soon i will write more on what i think we should be doing  but i would not put

361,1,2020-03-25 00:42:00,overall  a lockdown in india is a good idea  its healthcare infrastructure cannot handle even the flattest of curves  so social distancing not only flattens the curve but buys the government and private sector three weeks to increase capacity  in developed countries like the us  where capacity is high  the economic cost of shutdown is also high  but in india  the economic cost of a shutdown is lower  and the cost of a collapse in healthcare capacity because of premature stress is very high  so a lockdown in india makes sense for its conditions there are a few things to keep in mind to make this lockdown a success first  the indian government needs to rely on its private sector healthcare infrastructure  which is many times larger in capacity and services than the government provided free subsidized healthcare  there are 10 times more doctors in india working in the private sector than government hospitals  especially in urban areas   where the initial outbreaks are most expected and feared   private healthcare functions very well  the government should pay for the testing and treatment of the poor and those who cannot afford  and allow those who can pay to directly get those services  during emergencies  there is a temptation to requisition private capacity  which in this case will only impose stress on the healthcare infrastructure  the government should pump a lot of funds into the health sector  but allow the private sector to provision and increase the number of beds  health workers  ventilators  masks etc  the current allocation of 150 billion rupees  about 2 billion usd  announced by modi is too little  it is about  1 5 per indian  this amount needs to be increased many times over  the returns in terms of saving lives immediately  and improving healthcare infrastructure will be worth it in the long term second  the government must resist the temptation to impose price controls and quantity controls and let the markets work  india has very local supply chains and all essential goods  mainly food and dairy  will be available easily  price controls during a lockdown will only exacerbate the problem  a price is a signal wrapped up in an incentive  it signals shortages and surpluses and it also incentivizes buyers and sellers to adjust their behavior  government imposed price controls must be avoided completely  india has banned exports of medical essentials like masks and ventilators  which is currently justified and sufficient  indian entrepreneurs will respond to the emergency if prices are allowed to function and the dreaded essential commodities act  which has significantly distorted prices in the past  and unintentionally prevented essential goods from reaching people  is kept at bay third  india has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty  but still has about 275 million living below the poverty line i e  less than  1 25 a day  in addition to these  another 300 million are highly vulnerable to economic stress  70  of indians work in the informal sector  on short contracts  usually daily or weekly wage  and will have no income with a 21 day lockdown  even after the lockdown is lifted  sectors like construction may not revive immediately  india needs to announce some kind of quasi universal income  or subsidy that is not means tested  for at least 700 million ofits 1 35 billion population  a minimum of at least rs 2 500 a month  which is the indian poverty line  to keep these indians at home  and not desperate  is essential  if this has to be continued for three months  it would amount to  2 6  of gdp  this is a stimulus which india can  under these circumstances  afford  and without which millions of poor may die because of the lockdown and not the pandemic  without this  the chances of the success of the lockdown is low  it will also soften the aggregate demand contraction which is inevitable during a 21 day lockdown finally  assume goodwill  there is a tendency to pass draconian measures in an emergency to punish the few hoarders and scamsters in any situation  the problem with bad laws that are only designed to prevent scamsters  whether it is for hospital funding  ubi like subsidies  or removing price controls  is that it creates bad incentives for others  and discourages provisioning of goods and services by others  mostly operating on good faith  and the cost of punishing the scamsters in this emergency is too high  assume some small percentage of people will take advantage of all this  and carry on the lockdown is the first step  but india must not squander the next 21 days  and prepare on a war footing to increase its healthcare infrastructure ,[],38,2020-03-25 00:55:45

376,1,2020-03-23 02:00:26,this is an email  all from him  i will not add in any other formatting  like you  i have an extraordinarily deep concern about the capacity for businesses   not only smbs  but also larger  capital intensive firms   to weather this   i was quite surprised to hear russ take a lighter note  i am deeply sceptical of the efficacy of bridge loans that you   while  have laid out the best transmission mechanism  i can not possibly envision it will move the needle enough for the majority of those businesses while also not leaving a wake of loss provisions for future generations  i suppose you could say  i also simply cannot understand the legal logistics of bridge loans in this scenario  most companies will have a capital structure of some kind  perhaps without the most sophisticated lenders   how are you cramming down those who you are priming in the capital structure  you need consent  who will be managing this incredibly laborious process of gaining consent and creating the terms  cash grants are one thing  but bridge loans that are not unsecured at the bottom of the capital structure are an entirely different matter   while the benefit of hindsight can be a hindrance to pontificating on novel circumstances  it strikes me as unequivocally true that the gfc had a much simpler   intellectually  if not politically   solution  namely a solution that at its core involved taking known  marketable securities out of the system at haircuts or depressed valuations to abate panic  settle markets  and of course eventually sell at a profit in short  i am partial to the view that mark to market accounting was both a central impetus for why the crisis was so severe and why action could be taken so decisively without burdening tax payers for generations to come  see  and   both of which you are likely familiar with   this crisis provides no such  simple  solutions that can be concentrated against a singular sector of the economy by taking decisive action  i  of course  have no grand unified theory to share with you  however  i did want to pass along some thoughts i had upon reading your bridge loan piece that came to mind  like you  i am also worried about how broad the demand shock is currently and will be moving forward  affecting not only every industry severely  but also every locality in the economy  e g  leaving no state or municipality without deep  painful bruises   this raises the question of how the economy   when this is all said and done   reconstitutes itself in an orderly  efficient fashion while i am partial i believe one of the incredible strengths of the united states is its bankruptcy code  in particular  the out of court and chapter 11 processes i would perhaps mull over how the united states can leverage the bankruptcy code to provide support  both out of court  e g  before filing  and to expedite the process while in court  e g  by utilizing pre packs  which are very popular  very quick  and incredibly effective at providing sustainable balance sheets  one would hope that if the united states does something like this it could serve three useful functions using the bankruptcy code in this way would allow the united states to help firms  albeit  likely slightly larger ones than mom and pops  in a predictable  known  guaranteed way while also protecting tax payers from taking significant downside risk positions in an ad hoc and convoluted matter via bridge loans  if they are feasible at all  which i doubt   in short  the united states would leverage the incredibly strong institutional and intellectual framework of its existing bankruptcy code i believe   as i believe you do as well   that we are in for a much lengthier protraction than many anticipate i do not believe goldman is forecast that we will see 13  gdp growth in q3  i do not believe demand will return so quickly or in such force  because i do not believe we will return to normalcy as quickly as we have just departed it as i said previously  i have no grand unified theory to get american business through this crisis  however  we both agree in the general goodness of big business as a driver of america  what i have just laid out is perhaps the most politically palpable solution  because it involves bankruptcy  even if only in name only  that can give a strong life line to those currently in need while not exposing taxpayers to absurd  albeit still large  credit risk  this solution also can be worked to protect pension liabilities and other essential worker benefits i think it is inevitable that we have mass insolvencies  dislocations  and mismatches moving forward  for small businesses  there are solutions around the edges  but i simply cannot comprehend how the united states would be able to figure out and then extend the appropriate levels of credit via bridge loans en masse to these folks  it is surreal to imagine it possibly working and i worry deeply about what such a program   if tried  almost certainly with less dollars than would be required   would do to the social fabric and psyche of the american people when firms inevitably still buckle and break i have not given much thought to how to leverage the institutional framework of america to best ameliorate this crisis  but i have seen no one speak much about how out of court or in court restructuring could be

  can we get a regulatory allowance for this  perhaps the hardest step example  readers  please check my back of the envelope math   if we assume base infection rate of the population is 1   then pooling of 11 samples has a  10  chance of coming out positive  if you run all positive pools through individual assays  the expected number of tests per person is 0 196 or a 5 1x multiple on testing throughput  and a 5 1x reduction in cost   this is a big deal if we look at this from the view of whole population biosurveillance after the outbreak period is over and we have a 0 1  base infection rate  pools of 32 samples have an expected number of tests per person at 0 0628 or a 15 9x multiple on throughput cost reduction putting prices on this  an initial whole us screen at 1  rate would require about 64m tests  afterward  performing periodic biosurveillance to find hot spots requires about 21m tests per whole population screen  at  10 assay  what some folks working on in field rt qpcr tests believe marginal cost could be   this is orders of magnitude less expensive than mitigations that deal with a closed economy for any extended period of time i am neither a policy nor medical expert  so perhaps i am missing something big here  is there really  20 on the ground or  something something  efficient market by the way   and trying to build up representative samples ","['ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', 'secure-web.cisco.com', 'cleantechnica.com']",75,2020-03-23 00:48:29

389,1,2020-03-21 00:16:32,dear tyler i have read the comments section of your post on herd immunity pretty carefully and a point nobody has yet brought out is the importance of variance in r0  suppose that an average r0 of 2 72 is made up of a  a low spreader subset of 90  of the population with r0 of 0 8 and b  10  of super spreaders with an r0 of 20 if what makes super spreaders different from the rest is just some invisible genetic factor  then using the average r0 of 2 72 in simulations may be a good approximation  and relaxing social distancing after the first wave may indeed lead to a large second wave but if what makes super spreaders different is a behavioral characteristic that also makes them much more likely to be infected than the rest of the population during the first wave  then the effect of the first wave may be much more permanent than the average r0 of 2 72 can capture suppose the first wave infects 5  of low spreaders and 50  of high spreaders  then after the first wave the uninfected population consists of a much smaller proportion of super spreaders than before and r0 for that population drops dramatically  to 1 86 in this example  more generally if there is variance in systematic individual characteristics that affect r0  and not just chance factors particular to the first wave   then stopping the epidemic requires only that enough of the high r0 individuals acquire immunity  that may happen naturally in the first wave  or it might be something that policy could influence  we may soon be able to test this by looking for a second wave in china as restrictions are relaxed an even more general point is that  unlike in many other familiar contexts  inequality in r0 is really good news  it reduces the size of the set of individuals whose behavior you need to influence  the more inequality the better ,[],40,2020-03-21 00:28:31

406,1,2020-03-19 00:50:34,from scott ellison sometimes  the best solutions to big problems are very simple  regarding the current outbreak of covid 19  i propose a solution that on the surface might seem preposterous  but if one manages to stay with it and really think through the potential benefits  then it emerges as a much more credible course of action i propose temporarily stopping time  this means that today is date  tuesday  march 17th  2020  will remain the current date until further notice  this also means that everything that happens in time  e g  mortgage due dates  payrolls  travel bookings  stock market trading  contractor gigs  concerts  sporting events  will be paused  it also means that all of these events remain on the books  and will continue as planned once time is resumed before reacting to this crazy idea  let us start with a very simple example of how manipulating time is already both commonplace and effective  i am talking about daylight savings time  a practice that everyone in the us is already accustomed to where we set our clocks forward one hour every spring  this simple  small action instantly changes the behavior of all 330 million us citizens  suddenly  every single one of us shows up to work a little earlier than we did the week before  and this massive collective action occurs seamlessly and with only minor need for rectifications  e g  some over night shift workers must be compensated differently for that paycheck  it is the impressive unity of action that is significant about this idea of manipulating time  and this feature is key in responding to a global pandemic  right now  we are dealing with all the fallout from this outbreak piecemeal  which is not sustainable nor very effective both from the standpoint of stopping the spread of the outbreak and from the standpoint of preserving our society and economy  we are spending trillions of dollars to keep time going  e g  sending every american  1 000 so they can pay their rent  sending airlines  50 billion so they can pay their jet notes  providing billions to banks to cover distressed assets   but none of this really relieves the need to keep going out and working and thus further spreading the virus  what is worse is that  in spending all this money to keep time going  there is no guarantee that the economy will be there to take back up the baton once government payments stop  how many travel plans  conferences  sports leagues  and other plans have already been cancelled along the way we should be targeting this massive government money for mission critical items like expanding hospital capacity  ensuring the food supply  and maintaining distribution networks  these are the mission critical activities that must continue even if the date is frozen  it will be readily apparent which of these activities is mission critical  and the trillions of dollars flowing from the government can be directed toward footing these bills in my opinion  the most important feature of this solution is that it can be easily implemented again in the future  right now  we are using all of our energy to keep time going  imagine a scenario in which a few months after this current outbreak subsides this virus mutates and strikes again  after all the work  and money  we have already put into keeping things on track  i sincerely doubt we will be ready to meet any follow up challenge ,[],91,2020-03-19 00:55:01

414,0,2020-03-17 13:51:35,a simple and medically feasible strategy is available now for treating covid 19 patients  transfuse blood plasma from recovered patients  the idea is that the antibodies from the recovered patients will help the infected patients  the idea is an old one and has been used before with some success  here is   who also makes other suggestions  a simple but potentially very effective tool that can be used in infectious outbreaks is to use the serum of patients who have recovered from the virus to treat patients who contract the virus in the future  patients with resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different viral antigens of 2019 ncov  some of these polyclonal anti bodies will likely neutralize the virus and prevent new rounds of infection  and the patients with resolved infection should produce 2019 ncov antibodies in high titer patients with resolved cases of 2019 ncov can simply donate plasma  and then this plasma can be transfused into infected patients  given that plasma donation is well established  and the transfusion of plasma is also routine medical care  this proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be put into place  indeed  the same rationale was used in the treatment of several ebola patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014 2015  including two american healthcare workers who became infected as the outbreak continues  more patients who survived infection will become available to serve as donors to make antisera for 2019 ncov  and a sizeable stock of antisera could be developed to serve as a treatment for the sickest patients kruse worries that the exponential growth of the pandemic will be too fast but i think he makes a mistake  the number of recovered patients will far exceed the number of hospitalized patients so the supply of plasma will rise more quickly than the demand convalescent blood therapy was used to treat people during the 1918 flu pandemic and appeared to be useful  see  for references to papers from that time   a  of patients treated with blood therapy during the 1918 flu found good results  noting  of course  that data from a hundred years ago was not ideal   patients with spanish influenza pneumonia who received influenza convalescent human blood products may have experienced a clinically important reduction in the risk for death  convalescent human h5n1 plasma could be an effective  timely  and widely available treatment that should be studied in clinical trials blood therapy has also been used periodically since that time to treat ebola patients  mers patients  junin patients and others but under non ideal conditions where lots of things were being tried at the same time and controls were not ideal  results have been mostly positive or non negative  e g   on 84 ebola patients found few benefits but also small costs  blood therapy has also been used for animals to implement we need a database of recovered patients  the recovered patients then needed to be tested to find those with the most antibodies  it is probably best to use recovered patients from the same location to maximize overlap although the chinese brought plasma from china to italy  most of the dangers from blood transfusion such as passing on another disease are well understood and should be manageable with testing and knowledge of donors  in rare cases such as dengue it can bad to stimulate the immune system  see discussion   plasma therapy is not difficult and there are firms with expertise in the field including  and  the latter of whom developed a   thus  cbp seems worthy of consideration hat tip  monique van hoek ,"['ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', 'ncbi.nlm.nih.gov', 'takeda.com', 'twitter.com', 'newsroom.regeneron.com']",51,2020-03-17 14:05:20

485,0,2020-03-05 07:23:31,in poor countries the price of electricity is low  so low that  utilities lose money on every unit of electricity that they sell   as a result  rationing and shortages are common  writing in the jep   argue that  these shortfalls arise as a consequence of treating electricity as a right  rather than as a private good  how can treating electricity as a right undermine the aim of universal access to reliable electricity  we argue that there are four steps  in step 1  because electricity is seen as a right  subsidies  theft  and nonpayment are widely tolerated  bills that do not cover costs  unpaid bills  and illegal grid connections become an accepted part of the system  in step 2  electricity utilities also known as distribution companies lose money with each unit of electricity sold and in total lose large sums of money  though governments provide support  at some point  budget constraints start to bind  in step 3  distribution companies have no option but to ration supply by limiting access and restricting hours of supply  in effect  distribution companies try to sell less of their product  in step 4  power supply is no longer governed by market forces  the link between payment and supply has been severed  those evading payment receive the same quality of supply as those who pay in full  the delinking of payment and supply reinforces the view described in step 1 that electricity is a right  and leads to  a low quality  low payment equilibrium the burgess et al  analysis coheres with my observations in india where  wire anarchy  is common  see picture   it is obvious that electricity is being stolen but no one does anything about it because it is considered a right and a government that did do something about it would be voted out of power the stolen electricity means that the utility cannot cover its costs  government subsidies are rarely enough to satisfy the demand at a zero or low price and so the utility rations the consequences for electricity consumers  both rich and poor  are severe  there is only one electricity grid  and it becomes impossible to offer a higher quantity or quality of supply to those consumers who are willing and sometimes even desperate to pay for it moreover the issue is not poverty  per se   the vast majority of customers in bihar expect no penalty from paying a bill late  illegally hooking into the grid  wiring around a meter  or even bribing electricity officials to avoid payment  these attitudes are in stark contrast to how the same consumers view payment for private goods like cellphones  it is debatable whether cellphones are more important than electricity  but in bihar we find that the poor spend three times more on cellphones than they do on elec tricity  1 7 versus 0 6 percent of total expenditure  burgess et al  frame the issue as  treating electricity as right   but one can can also understand this equilibrium as arising from low state capacity and corruption  in particular corruption with theft  in corruption with theft the buyer pays say a meter reader to look the other way as they tap into the line and they get a lower price for electricity  net of the bribe   corruption with theft is a strong equilibrium because buyers who do not steal have higher costs and thus are driven out of the market  in addition  corruption with theft unites the buyer and the corrupt meter reader in secrecy  since both are gaining from the transaction  as  this result suggests that the first step to reduce corruption should be to create an accounting system that prevents theft from the government burgess et al  agree noting   reforms might seek to reduce theft of electricity and nonpayment of bills  and they point to programs in india and pakistan that allow utilities to cut off entire neighborhoods when bills are not paid  needless to say  such hardball tactics require some level of trust that when the bills are paid the electricity will be provided and at higher levels of quality this may be easier to do when there are other sources of authority such as in essence the problem is that the government is too beholden to electricity consumers  if the government could commit to a regime of no or few subsidies  firms would supply electricity and prices would be low and quality high  but if firms do invest in the necessary electricity infrastructure the government will break its promise and exploit the firms for temporary electoral advantage  as a result  the consumers do not get much electricity  the government faces a time consistency problem  independent courts would help to bind the government but those often are not available in developing countries  another possibility is a conservative electricity czar who  like adoes not share the preferences of the government or the voters  again that requires some independence in short  to ensure that everyone has access to high quality electricity the government must

516,1,2020-02-28 00:13:03,chris  a loyal  mr  reader  writes to me i have been turning to your insights on prizes vs  grants over the years  your  is without question the best discussion i have found of their respective merits i was wondering if your thinking on prizes vs  grants has evolved  and in particular  tc has added the numbers here  1  in the google talk  you talked about an equilibrium in which there would be a growing ecosystem of big prizes complementing one another  i am not sure it has turned out this way  do you agree  and what happened  did the  failure  of some high profile prizes  e g  the google lunar xprize  dampen down the enthusiasm 2  more generally  there seemed to be an expectation in the 2000s and early 2010s that prizes would take off and become a more significant feature of the r d funding landscape  again  i do not think that has really happened  what explains that 3  looking specifically at government funding of r d  do you think there is an equilibrium in which grants can coexist with prizes  or do grants squeeze out prizes through some form of adverse selection  the best researchers opting for grants over prizes  4  how important do you think public choice reasons are for us being in a grant dominated equilibrium  it seems that the science sector has done a great job of positioning itself as something other than an interest group  with its interests squarely aligned with the public good   even suggesting that the science sector is  also  an interest group seems slightly heretical  it is interesting that dominic cummings  for all his radicalism  seems to see little need for any reform of the science research ecosystem beyond arpa  first a general remark  i now see the current scientific  and cultural  establishment as having more  implicit  prizes than i used to realize   in fact  getting a grant is one of the biggest prizes you can receive  if the grant is sufficiently prestigious   by an  implicit prizes   i mean a prize where the target achievement is not quite spelled out  but if  we   however defined  judge you to have achieved enough  we will pour grants  status  and high quality social networks into your lap   for instance  alex and i have received significant  prizes  for writing  mr   although none of those prizes have names or bring explicit public recognition  as opposed to general recognition   we have in contrast never received a grant to write  mr   so are prizes really so under provided so my current thinking is a bit less  grants vs  prizes   and somewhat more  implicit prizes vs  explicit prizes  each combined with grants to varying degrees    implicit prizes are more flexible  but they also are easier to cheat with  since the standard of achievement is never quite clear   implicit prizes also are much more valuable to people who can use  build  and exploit their social networks  and of course that is not everyone  but  should not  we be giving more prizes to those people     implicit prizes also can be revoked through subsequent loss of status   implicit prizes are more likely  granted  by the hands of social networks rather than judging panels  all of those features being both cost and benefit now to the specific points 1  as the venture capital ecosystem grows  and as the value of publicity rises  it is easier to monetize scientific and other sources of fame   and there are more  influencers in the broad sense    there are more implicit prizes to be had    and did the lunar xprize fail   if an end is not worth accomplishing  a prize is one way to find that out 2  in addition to my point about the proliferation of implicit prizes  the scientific  academic  and political communities are far too conservative in the literal sense of that word   how many top schools experiment with different tenure procedures   different ways of running a department   it is sad how difficult it is to experiment with changes in academia and science  whether the topic be prizes or not 3  the best researchers get both grants and prizes  one hopes  by the way  here is  on the empirics of prizes  mostly positive results ,"['youtube.com', 'nber.org']",18,2020-02-28 00:36:50

645,1,2020-02-01 01:48:54,a key question in the literature on motivated reasoning and self deception is how motivated beliefs are sustained in the presence of feedback  in this paper  we explore dynamic motivated belief patterns after feedback  we establish that positive feedback has a persistent effect on beliefs  negative feedback  instead  influences beliefs in the short run  but this effect fades over time  we investigate the mechanisms of this dynamic pattern  and provide evidence for an asymmetry in the recall of feedback  finally  we establish that  in line with theoretical accounts  incentives for belief accuracy mitigate the role of motivated reasoning that is  by florian zimmerman   and from the paper proper we find that negative feedback is indeed recalled with significantly lower accuracy  compared to positive feedback  which suggests that the dynamic belief pattern we have identified is indeed driven by the selective recall of information  next  we make use of additional outcome variables and a placebo condition to delve into how selective recall operates  in a nutshell  the following patterns emerge  our results suggest that participants are able to suppress the recall of unwanted memories  furthermore  participants appear to suppress the recall of not only negative feedback but also the iq test more broadly  our results lend direct support to key modeling assumptions in bénabou and tirole  2002  2004   from a policy perspective  our findings suggest that policy interventions aimed at correcting self servingly biased misperceptions via information or feedback are unlikely to be effective in the long run due to people is ability to forget or suppress information that threatens their desired views the paper also shows that incentives matter and can improve the problem   for instance  if you tell people that they will have to recall the information at some point in the future  and will receive a monetary reward for accuracy  there is considerably less selective forgetting ,['pubs.aeaweb.org'],36,2020-02-01 02:08:08

so the main foreign policy issue  the main substantive social issue   we are less polarized  and then  domestic spending  it seems  we all mostly agree  why is that wrong  klein   i am not sure it is wrong  two things i would say about it  one  the word  main  is doing a lot of work in that argument  the question is  how do you decide what are the main issues  i would not say domestic regulation of tech is a main issue  for instance  i think it is important  but compared to things like immigration and healthcare  at least in the way people experience that and think about that   or if you ask them what are their main issues  domestic regulation of tech does not crack the top 10 and  cowen   but again  at any point in time  if positions are shifting rapidly   as they are  say  on trade   if you took all of gdp  even healthcare   that is what  maybe 18 percent of gdp  but a lot of the system  a lot of people in both parties agree on  even if they disagree on obamacare  obamacare is part of that 18 percent  over what percent of gdp are we more polarized than we used to be  as compared to less polarized  what is your estimate  klein   i like that question  let me try to think about this  i do not think i have a gdp answer for you  but let me try to give you more of what i think of as a mechanism i think a useful heuristic here   people do not have nearly as strong views on policy qua policy as certainly people like you and i tend to assume they do  the way that washington  dc  talks about politics is incredibly projection oriented  we talk about politics as if everybody is a political junkie with highly distinct ideologies political scientists have done a lot of polling on this  going all the way back to the 1960s  and it seems something like 20 to 30 percent of the population has what we would think of as a coherent policy oriented ideology  where things fit together  and they have everything lined up  most people do not hold policy positions all that strongly what happens is that they do hold   to the extent they are involved in politics   identity strongly  political affiliations quite strongly  they know who is on their side and who is not the pattern that i see here  again and again  is that when things are out of the spotlight  when they are not being argued about  when they are not the thing that the parties are disagreeing about  they are actually quite nonpolarized  you will sit there in rooms of experts  there will be a panel here  george mason  whatever it might be  and everybody will have some good ideas about how you can make the system better for everyone then what will happen is  the eye of sauron of the american political system will turn towards whatever the policy issue is  maybe it is obamacare  maybe it is climate change  remember  climate change was not that polarized 15 20 years ago  john mccain had a big cap and trade plan in his 2008 platform  and  cowen   if you could engineer your own political temperament  would you change it from how it is  mostly  we are stuck with what we have got  i would say  but if you could press the button   more passionate  less passionate  something else  goldilocks  klein   i think i like my political temperament  probably for the era of politics we are moving into  and for my job  it would almost be better to be of a more conflict oriented temperament than i am  i think that we are moving into something that  at least in the short term  is rewarding or is going to reward those who really like getting in fights all the time  and i do not like that i am more consensus oriented  i like hearing people out  i probably have a little bit more of a moderate temperament in that way  but i would not really change that about myself  i think it is a shame that so much of politics happens on twitter now  but that is the way it is  i would not change  me  to operate to that recommended  and again here is  ,"['medium.com', 'amazon.com',

higher education  typically involving community colleges 8   health care policy   her various takes on this  including   are better thought of as  vacillating  political strategy than policy  per se    in any case  no matter what your view on health care policy she has botched it  and several other dem candidates have a better track record in this area   even paul krugman insists that the democrats should move away from single payer purity   it is hard to give her net positive points on this one  again no matter what your policy views on health care  or even no matter what her views may happen to be on a particular day all of my analysis  i should note  can be derived internal to democratic party economics  and it does not require any dose of libertarianism 9   breaking up the big tech companies   i am strongly opposed to this  and i view it as yet another attack destruction on a leading and innovative american sector   i will say this  though  unlike the rest of the list above  i know smart economists  and tech experts  who favor some version of the policy   still  i do not see why jerry and will should like this promise so much those are some pretty major sectors of the u s  economy  it is not like making a few random mistakes with the regulation of toothpicks   in fact they are  the  major sectors of the u s  economy  and each and every one of them would take a big hit more generally  she seems to be a fan of instituting policies through executive order  a big minus in my view and probably for jerry and will as well   villainization and polarization are consistent themes in her rhetoric  and at this point it does not seem her chances for either the nomination  or beating trump  are strong in fact her conditional chance of victory is  that of the other major dem candidates   so what really are you getting for all of these outbursts when i add all that up  she seems to have the worst economic and political policies of any candidate in my adult lifetime  with the possible exception of   whose views are often less detailed  i do readily admit this  warren is a genius at exciting the egalitarian and anti business mood affiliation of our coastal media and academic elites if you would like to read defenses of warren  here is  and here is    i think they both plausibly point to parts of the warren program that might be good  more good for them than for me i should add  but still i can grasp the other arguments on her behalf    they do not much respond to the point that on  1 8  and possibly  1 9  she has the worst economic and political policies of any candidate in my adult lifetime for jerry and will  i just do not see the attraction at all that said  on her foreign policy  which i have not spent much time with  she might be better  so of course you should consider the whole picture   and quite possibly there are other candidates who  for other reasons  are worse yet  not hard to think of some   or you might wish to see a woman president   or you might think she would stir up  good discourse  on the issues you care about   and i fully understand that most of the warren agenda would not pass so i am not trying to talk you out of supporting her   still  i would like to design and put into the public domain a small emoji  one that you could add to the bottom of your columns and tweets   it would stand in for   yes i support her  but she has the worst proposed economic policies of any candidate in the adult lifetime of tyler cowen  ,"['google.com', 'marginalrevolution.com', 'bloomberg.com', 'marginalrevolution.com',

789,1,2020-01-01 01:29:48,having tracked the libertarian  movement  for much of my life  i believe it is now pretty much hollowed out  at least in terms of flow   one branch split off into ron paul ism and less savory alt right directions  and another  more establishment branch remains out there in force but not really commanding new adherents   for one thing  it does not seem that old style libertarianism can solve or even very well address a number of major problems  most significantly climate change   for another  smart people are on the internet  and the internet seems to encourage synthetic and eclectic views  at least among the smart and curious   unlike the mass culture of the 1970s  it does not tend to breed  capital l libertarianism    on top of all that  the out migration from narrowly libertarian views has been severe  most of all from educated women there is also the word  classical liberal   but what is  classical  supposed to mean that is not question begging   the classical liberalism of its time focused on 19th century problems   appropriate for the 19th century of course   but from wwii onwards it has been a very different ballgame along the way  i believe the smart classical liberals and libertarians have  as if guided by an invisible hand  evolved into a view that i dub with the entirely non sticky name of  state capacity libertarianism    i define state capacity libertarianism in terms of a number of propositions 1  markets and capitalism are very powerful  give them their due 2  earlier in history  a strong state was necessary to back the formation of capitalism and also to protect individual rights  do read  on state capacity    strong states remain necessary to maintain and extend capitalism and markets   this includes keeping china at bay abroad and keeping elections free from foreign interference  as well as developing effective laws and regulations for intangible capital  intellectual property  and the new world of the internet    if you have read   you will know this is  not  a call for massive regulation of big tech  3  a strong state is distinct from a very large or tyrannical state   a good strong state should see the maintenance and extension of capitalism as one of its primary duties  in many cases its  1 duty 4  rapid increases in state capacity can be very dangerous  earlier japan  germany   but high levels of state capacity are not inherently tyrannical   denmark should in fact have a smaller government  but it is still one of the freer and more secure places in the world  at least for danish citizens albeit  5  many of the failures of today is america are failures of excess regulation  but many others are failures of state capacity   our governments cannot address climate change  much improve k 12 education  fix traffic congestion  or improve the quality of their discretionary spending   much of our physical infrastructure is stagnant or declining in quality   i favor much more immigration  nonetheless i think our government needs clear standards for who cannot get in  who will be forced to leave  and a workable court system to back all that up and today we do not have that either those problems require state capacity   albeit to boost markets   in a way that classical libertarianism is poorly suited to deal with   furthermore  libertarianism is parasitic upon state capacity libertarianism to some degree   for instance  even if you favor education privatization  in the shorter run we still need to make the current system much better   that would even make privatization easier  if that is your goal 6  i will cite again the philosophical framework of my book  7  the fundamental growth experience of recent decades has been the rise of capitalism  markets  and high living standards in east asia  and state capacity libertarianism has no problem or embarrassment in endorsing those developments   it remains the case that such progress  or better  could have been made with more markets and less government   still  state capacity had to grow in those countries and indeed it did   public health improvements are another major success story of our time  and those have relied heavily on state capacity   let us just admit it 8  the major problem areas of our time have been africa and south asia   they are both lacking in markets and also in state capacity 9  state capacity libertarians are more likely to have positive views of infrastructure  science subsidies  nuclear power  requires state support    and space programs than are mainstream libertarians or modern democrats   modern democrats often claim to favor those items  and sincerely in my view  but de facto they are very willing to sacrifice them for redistribution  egalitarian and fairness concerns  mood affiliation  and serving traditional democratic interest groups   for instance  modern democrats have run new york for some time now  and they have done a terrible job building and fixing things   nor are democrats doing much to boost nuclear power as a partial solution to climate change  if anything the contrary 10  state capacity libertarianism has no problem endorsing   whereas traditional libertarianism is more likely to embrace or at least be wishy washy toward small  corrupt regimes  due to some of the residual liberties they leave behind 11  state capacity libertarianism is not non interventionist in foreign policy  as it believes in strong alliances with other relatively free nations  when feasible   that said  the usual libertarian  problems of intervention because government makes a lot of mistakes  bar still should be applied to specific military actions   but the alliances can be hugely beneficial  as illustrated by much of 20th century foreign policy and today much of asia   which still relies on pax americana it is interesting to contrast state capacity libertarianism to liberaltarianism  another offshoot of libertarianism   on most substantive issues  the liberaltarians might be very close to state capacity libertarians   but emphasis and focus really matter  and i would offer this  partial  list of differences a  the liberaltarian starts by assuring  the left  that they favor lots of government transfer programs   the state capacity libertarian recognizes that demands of mercy are never ending  that economic growth can benefit people more than transfers  and  within the governmental sphere  it is willing to emphasize an analytical   cold hearted  comparison between government discretionary spending and transfer spending   discretionary spending might well win out at many margins b  the  polarizing left  is explicitly opposed to a lot of capitalism  and de facto standing in opposition to state capacity  due to the polarization  which tends to thwart problem solving   the polarizing left is thus a bigger villain for state capacity libertarianism than it is for liberaltarianism   for the liberaltarians  temporary alliances with the polarizing left are possible because both oppose trump and other bad elements of the right wing   it is easy   maybe too easy   to market liberaltarianism to the left as a critique and revision of libertarians and conservatives c  liberaltarian will wilkinson made the mistake of expressing enthusiasm for elizabeth warren   it is hard to imagine a state capacity libertarian making this same mistake  since so much of warren is energy is directed toward tearing down american business   ban fracking  really   send money to russia  saudi arabia  lose american jobs  and make climate change worse  all at the same time   nope d  state capacity libertarianism is more likely to make a mistake of say endorsing high speed rail from la to sf  if indeed that is a mistake   and decrying the ability of u s  governments to get such a thing done    which mistakes they are most likely to commit  is an underrated way of assessing political philosophies you will note the influence of peter thiel on state capacity libertarianism  though i have never heard him frame the issues in this way furthermore   which ideas survive well in internet debate  has been an important filter on the evolution of the doctrine   that point is under discussed  for all sorts of issues  and it may get a blog post of its own here is   relevant for background happy new year

794,1,2019-12-31 00:11:12,ian bremmer offers  of all the wrongdoing  which i will not summarize here   in any case  many of you have asked me what i think of these recent events i do not at all favor replacing india is secular democracy with  hindu nation  as a ruling principle   for one thing  i believe in strong libertarian protections for minority rights against state power  including for muslims   i also believe these moves will be bad for india is economy   nonetheless i find most of the extant commentary on modi fairly misleading and or naive as this outsider sees it  india is secular democracy was never liberal   it had certain de facto liberal elements  but largely out of low levels of state capacity  necessitating a kind of tolerance but of course also leading to a very sub par infrastructure   furthermore  it has been commonly described by political scientists as a  democracy without accountability    national voting has so much to do with religion  caste  and other particularistic principles that indian democracy never enforced superior practical performance as it should have then enter several forces at more or less the same time  including modi  ongoing indian economic growth  higher expectations and thus greater demands for state capacity  a rise in what is called  populism   and also an increase in the focality of islam and also terrorism around the world in essence that state capacity starts to be built and part of it is turned to wrong ends  in an attempt to appeal to the roughly 80 percent hindu majority   here is  the modi administration has also done a better job than previous governments in pushing big anti poverty initiatives  such as building 100 million toilets to help stop open defecation and the spread of deadly disease in other words  the positive and negative sides of the story here may be more closely related than is comfortable to contemplate   the picture reminds me a bit of how parts of renaissance europe were often more anti semitic or racist than medieval europe  in part because persecuting states had more resources and it was easier to mobilize intolerant sentiment  partly due to the printing press   i do not however idolize medieval times as being so libertarian  rather the earlier ideology contained the seeds of the renaissance oppressions  which in time turned into foreign imperialism as well similarly  oppression and religious conflict is hardly news in india  for instance you may recall the  which in the 1940s killed at least one million people and displaced at least 10 million more none of this is to excuse any of these oppressions  whether in india or elsewhere   the libertarian rights still ought to apply  and should be written into the indian constitution and laws more firmly  it is an interesting and much under discussed result that the greatest violations of libertarian rights tend to come in periods of high  delta  in state capacity  not high absolute levels of state capacity per se   the nazi government was not  that  large as a percentage of gdp  but it was growing rapidly in terms of its efficacy along certain dimensions  the moral and resonant message here is  libertarian rights for minorities truly are important and beware state power    and somehow we need to think strategically  at a deep level  how that message can be combined with the inevitable and indeed desirable growth in indian state capacity   the libertarians only make this their issue by eliding the need for growth in state capacity   so they moralize correctly about the situation  but they do not see the underlying dilemma so clearly either consider   modi is not a normal politician who measures his success only by votes   said kanchan chandra  a political scientist at new york university   he sees himself as the architect of a new india  built on a foundation of technological  cultural  economic and military prowess  and backed by an ideology of hindu nationalism  the real question here is   still mostly unanswered    what else is the new ideology of state capacity supposed to be    i am happy to put in my vote for anglo american liberalism  but still i recognize that probably will not command either a majority or even a plurality here is   rahul gandhi felt people would support the congress on issues of farmers  youth  employment  inflation  but  the core issues were left behind and surgical strikes and nationalism were highlighted  the congress was dubbed a muslim party  are not we nationalists   gehlot asked i am not so impressed   or try this discussion    again  on the ideas front underwhelming  at least for this classical liberal   maybe something good can come out of   nyt  all the more  the  establishment media  just is not interested in framing the story in terms of individual rights and  constraints  on democracy   that narrative is too well  libertarian  and also anti statist for one example  blame either nilinjana roy or the person who titled her ft column      last i checked  modi was elected  then re elected  and his party and its allies control almost 2 3 of the lower house   that is truly an orwellian column title   it should not be so hard to write  the problem with modi is the statism  and lack of respect for minority rights  sadly this is democratically certified and thus democracy requires real constitutional constraint of the powers of the government    but so many people today are mentally and emotionally incapable of thinking and writing such thoughts  having spent so much time in their mood affiliation glorifying  democracy   or what they take to be democracy  above all other values so we should be spending our time developing and publicizing a new  non modi  ideology for greater state capacity in india  combined of course

815,1,2019-12-26 00:14:12,his new book is coming out in january  and the subtitle is   i will get to the details shortly  but my bottom line review is  not as controversial as you might think   but do note the normalization at the end of that phrase here is one bit from p 294 toward the end of the book nothing we are going to learn will diminish our common humanity   nothing we learn will justify rank ordering human groups from superior to inferior   the bundles of qualities that make us human are far too complicated for that   nothing we learn will lend itself to genetic determinism   we live our lives with an abundance of unpredictability  both genetic and environmental most of the book defends ten key propositions  laid out on pp 7 8   the first four of those propositions concern differences between men and women   sex differences in personality are consistent worldwide    and i do not find those controversial  so i will not cover them   the chapters on those propositions provide a good survey of the evidence  and a good answer to the denialists  though i doubt if murray is the right person to win them over   let us now turn to the other propositions  with my commentary along the way 5  human populations are genetically distinctive in ways that correspond to self identified race and ethnicity true  but murray is analysis did not push me beyond the usual citations of lactose intolerance  sickle cell anemia  adaptation to high altitudes  and the like   that said  pp 190 195 offer a very dense discussion of target alleles for various traits  such as schizophrenia  and how those target alleles vary across different groups   i found those pages difficult to follow  and also wished that discussion had been fifty pages rather than five   toward the end of that discussion  murray does write  p 194     proof of the role of natural selection for many genetic differences will remain unobservable without methodological breakthroughs    with that i definitely agree on p 195 he adds  it is implausible to expect that none of the imbalances will yield evidence of significant genetic differences related to phenotypic differences across continental populations    that returns to my core point about this book not shifting    you could agree with that sentence  noting the ambiguity in the word  significant   and still have a quite modest vision of what those differences might mean   in any case  nothing in the book pushes me beyond that sentence in the direction of the geneticists and here the contrast with the chapters on men and women becomes  unintentionally   glaring   those  biological differences are relatively easy to demonstrate  so perhaps hard to demonstrate biological differences are not so significant   that too is just a conjecture  but there are multiple ways to play the  absence of evidence  and  how to interpret the residuals  cards  and i wish those had received a more extensive philosophy of science like discussion now let us move to the next proposition 6  evolutionary selection pressure since humans left africa has been extensive and mostly local that one strikes me as a miswording or misstatement  though i do not see that it corresponds to any actual mistakes in the broader text   you might think that general   non  local evolutionary selection for all humans has been quite large over the millennia  relative to local selection   i genuinely do not know the ratio here  but murray does not seem to address the actual comparison of  across all human groups  vs   local  as loci of selection pressures next up 7  continental population differences in variants associated with personality  abilities  and social behavior are common clearly true  but note this proposition does not claim biological roots for those differences   the real question comes in the next proposition 8  the shared environment usually plays a minor role in explaining personalities  abilities  and social behavior here i have what i think is a major disagreement with murray   if he means the term  shared environment  in the narrow sense used by say twin studies  he is probably correct   but in the more literal  webster derived conception of  shared environment  i very much disagree   culture is a truly major shaper of our personalities  abilities  and social behavior  and self evidently so  for my taste the book did not contain nearly enough discussion of culture and in fact there is virtually no discussion of the concept or its power  as a look at the index will verify   the real lesson of  twins studies plus anthropology  is that you have to control  almost all  of a person is environment to have a major impact  but a major impact indeed can be had   i behave very differently than my irish potato famine ancestors  and not because i am genetically 1 8 from the madeira islands   that said  within the narrower range of environmental variation measured in twins studies well those studies seem to be fairly accurate 9  class structure is importantly based on differences in abilities that have a substantial genetic component correct as stated  but i see those differences as much less genetic than murray does   for instance  iq is to some extent heritable  but how much does that shape economic outcomes   it is worth turning to murray is discussion on p 232 and the associated footnote 17  pp 428 429    his main source is what is to me a flawed  on iq and job performance  murray to his credit does also cite  of such studies    i would opt more directly for the labor market literature on iq and individual earnings  based on actual measured wages  which shows fairly modest correlations between iq and earnings  read    and     so  at the very least  the inherited iq based permanent stratification version of  the bell curve  argument is much more compelling to murray than it is to me 10  outside interventions are inherently constrained in the effects they can have on personality  abilities  and social behavior clearly this is literally true  if only because of the meaning of  constrained    but mostly i would repeat my remarks on culture from  8   cultures change  and over time they are likely to change a great deal   for instance  early in the 20th century  korea  japan  and china often were described as low work ethic cultures   as cultures change  in turn those cultures can shape the personalities  abilities  and social behaviors of subsequent generations  in significant ways albeit constrained   so while murray is correct as stated  i believe i would disagree with his intended substantive point about the weight of relative forces overall this is a serious and well written book that presents a great deal of scientific evidence very effectively   anyone reading it will learn a lot   but it did not change my mind on much  least of all the most controversial questions in this area   if anything  in the bayesian sense it probably nudged me away from geneticist based arguments  simply because it did not push me any further towards them murray of course will write the book he wants to  but my personal wish list was two fold  a  a book leaving most of the normal science behind  and focusing only on the uncertain and controversial frontier issues  in great detail  and b   much  more discussion of the import of culture most of all  i am happy that america is culture of achievement is inducing murray to continue to produce major works at the age of 76  soon to be 77 you can pre order  ,"['amazon.com', 'marginalrevolution.com',

863,0,2019-12-14 07:33:16,men and women are different  a seemingly obvious fact to most of humanity but a long time subject of controversy within psychology  new large scale results using better empirical methods are resolving the debate  however  in favor of the person in the street  the basic story is that at the broadest level  ocean  differences are relatively small but that is because there are large  offsetting  differences between men and women at lower levels of aggregation  scott barry kaufman  writing at scientific american  has a  at the broad level  we have traits such as extraversion  neuroticism  and agreeableness  but when you look at the specific  facets  of each of these broad factors  you realize that there are some traits that males score higher on  on average   and some traits that females score higher on  on average   so the differences cancel each other out  this canceling out gives the appearance that sex differences in personality do not exist when in reality they  very much do exist  for instance  males and females  on average  do not differ much on extraversion  however  at the narrow level  you can see that males on average are more assertive  an aspect of extraversion  whereas females on average are more sociable and friendly  another aspect of extraversion   so what does the overall picture look like for males and females  on average  when going deeper than the broad level of personality  on average   males tend to be more dominant  assertive  risk prone  thrill seeking  tough minded  emotionally stable  utilitarian  and open to abstract ideas  males also tend to score higher on   even though   2   men also tend to form larger  competitive groups in which hierarchies tend to be stable and in which individual relationships tend to require little emotional investment  in terms of communication style  males tend to use more assertive speech and are more likely to interrupt people  both men and women  more often  especially  intrusive  interruptions  which can be interpreted as a form of dominant behavior  in contrast  females   on average   tend to be more sociable  sensitive  warm  compassionate  polite  anxious  self doubting  and more open to aesthetics   on average   women are more interested in intimate  cooperative dyadic relationships that are more emotion focused and characterized by unstable hierarchies and strong egalitarian norms  where aggression does arise  it tends to be more indirect and less openly confrontational  females also tend to display better communication skills  displaying higher verbal ability and the ability to decode other people is nonverbal behavior  women also tend to use more affiliative and tentative speech in their language  and tend to be more expressive in both their facial expressions and bodily language  although men tend to adopt a more expansive  open posture    on average   women also tend to smile and   although these effects are  very contextual  and the differences are substantially larger when males and females believe they are being observed than when they believe they are alone moreover  the differences in the subcategories are all  correlated  so while one might argue that even among the subcategories the differences are small on any single category when you put them all together the differences in male and female personalities are large and systematic relatively small differences across multiple traits can add up to substantial differences when considered as a  whole profile  of traits  take the human face  for example  if you were to just take a particular feature of the face  such as mouth width  forehead height  or eye size  you would have difficult differentiating between a male face and a female face  you simply cannot tell a male eyeball from a female eyeball  for instance  however  a look at the  combination  of facial features produces two very distinct clusters of male vs  female faces  in fact  observers can correctly determine sex from pictures   4   here is an interesting question   does the same apply to the domain of personality   there now exists four large scale studies that use this multivariate methodology  see       and    all four studies are conducted cross culturally and report on an analysis of narrow personality traits  which  as you may recall  is where most of the action is when it comes to sex differences   critically  all four studies converge on the same basic finding  when looking at the overall gestalt of human personality   there is a truly striking difference between the typical male and female personality profiles  just  how  striking  well  actually   really  striking  in one   tim kaiser  marco del giudice  and tom booth analyzed personality data from 31 637 people across a number of english speaking countries  the size of global sex differences was  d    2 10  it was  d    2 06 for just the united states   to put this number in context  a  d   2 10 means a classification accuracy of 85   in other words  their data suggests that the probability that a randomly picked individual will be correctly classified as male or female based on knowledge of their global personality profile is 85   after correcting for the unreliability of the personality tests  in other words  you can predict whether a person is male of female from their personality traits almost as well as by looking at their face  overall  the big differences are as follows consistent with prior research  the researchers found that the following traits are most exaggerated among females when considered separately from the rest of the gestalt  sensitivity  tender mindedness  warmth  anxiety  appreciation of beauty  and openness to change  for males  the most exaggerated traits were emotional stability  assertiveness dominance  dutifulness  conservatism  and conformity to social hierarchy and traditional structure i have also pointed out that  which is probably one reason why  in societies with greater equality  consistent with this  personality differences between the sexes are large in all cultures but  for all of these personality effects the sex differences tend to be larger  not smaller  in more individualistic  gender egalitarian countries  addendum  see john nye and co authors on testosterone and finger length for some

ireland  and gene wolfe and philip k  dick   here is one excerpt  cowen   arguably  dominant firms are easier to regulate  and since you seem to favor some kinds of additional regulation on the major tech companies  does this mean we are too worried about monopoly  that we actually want to keep around a few dominant firms  and that if we split them up into many small parts  there would be more chaos or more fake news or more privacy violations if some parts of what they do are bad  and you get more competition in the bad  do not we just want to put in gdpr barriers to entry  not quite public utilities  but keep them big and fat and happy and somewhat not so dynamic  yes or no  farrell   it depends on what you value  cowen   but what  you  value  farrell   yeah  let me put the tradeoff to you this way   if  you value security  if the highlight is on security  then the answer is  you probably want to keep big companies around because you are going to want to impose broad standards  you are going to want to create collective security goods  and the only actors that can really do that in a substantial way are big businesses of one sort or another if  alternatively  you value things like privacy and other kinds of rights  then you probably want to move towards an equilibrium in which there are far  far fewer big firms  so that is where i see the fight being played out  i see the fight being played out between people who value security and people who value privacy  i think they point in somewhat different directions  cowen   and where are you on that spectrum  farrell   well  it depends on the time of the day  and i find myself   cowen   it is 2 22 p m and  farrell   well  i guess the question for me is   and again  this is a wide open question because we simply do not have enough good empirical research   but what is the relationship and the broader ecology between companies like 8chan and companies like facebook  i suspect that companies like 8chan will be far  far less successful if there were not much bigger platforms like facebook that they could effectively grow upon so here are the arguments  something as follows  if you think about 8chan  and if you think about 4chan before it  they were basically meme factories  they were basically these places where these bored individuals hung out  you also created these memes in a kind of process of frenzied darwinian evolution  where you desperately want to make sure that whatever you had said was on the front page because otherwise it would disappear forever  so you have got this survival of the fittest thing  where incredibly valuable or incredibly effective memes go out and begin to populate the entire space but you need two things for that to work  first of all  you need a process of generation  and secondly  you need some kind of process of dissemination  you need other platforms which have far greater reach  which can then allow for these memes to propagate through the atmosphere i suspect that if we were in a world in which everything was at the scale of 8chan  rather than having a mixture of companies at the scale of 8chan and companies at the scale of facebook  that the likelihood of this stuff spreading and becoming epidemic across the entire community of internet users would be far  far less  obviously  we would have other problems then  but i think that the problems that we would face would be a very  very different set of problems from the problems that we face in the current environment finally  farrell   yes   gene  wolfe misleads us systematically  and clearly severian is not a reliable narrator  but then neither is proust is narrator either  i think that if you really want to understand where wolfe comes from  it really is proust  his writing style is proustian  his concern with time  with how it is that time works  is quintessentially proustian and you do not look to wolfe any more than you look to other science fiction for characterization  i do not think that is the particular strength  what you do look for is a kind of a sense of the world  and in wolfe  in particular  he provides this real understanding of how it is that the workings of society  and interestingly   conservative  understanding of the workings of society i think of him almost as being proust in reverse  proust is describing a world in which the modern world is overtaking aristocracy  and that clearly is one of the great problems of proust  what is happening on the social level  you have all of these aristocratic understandings  the merovingian  all of these histories  all of these castles  all of this wonderful art  and they are being replaced by the modern world with its telephones  with its electric lighting  and so on and how

1091,1,2019-10-23 00:43:09,the other day i asked whether our intuitions about minimum wages and also occupational licensing might be consistent   in particular  if we think occupational licensing is very bad for employment and prices and welfare  is that consistent with monopsony low elasticity of demand for labor models that is a tough problem  here is one approach if you think minimum wage hikes are fine  typically you believe something like  a 20 percent hike in the required wage will not much damage employment  if at all  what then would you say to this   a 20 percent training surcharge on all worker hires will not much damage employment  if at all  it seems you should believe the second proposition as well now  consider occupational licensing   typically it is not absolute   only 300 goldsmiths in florence     but rather it imposes a surcharge on entrants   they have to pass a test  or undergo training  or receive a degree of some kind   they must incur training costs to get the license  and you can think of those training costs as a tax on the employment relationship   but if those costs are incurred  a worker passes through the permeable membrane of the licensing restriction into the active labor force pool of that sector of course we all know that a tax can be borne by either side of the market  depending on elasticities now  if you believe minimum wage hikes do not much harm employment  you believe the demand for labor is relatively inelastic   and if you believe the demand for labor is inelastic  the burden of the training costs for licensing fall on the employer  not the worker   taxes fall on the inelastic side of the market now  you have already assented to   a 20 percent training surcharge on all worker hires will not much damage employment  if at all  so the occupational licensing should not much damage employment either   the employer simply picks up the tab  albeit grudgingly  the effect on consumer prices will depend on market structure  for instance you can have a local monopsonist shipping into in a largely competitive broader market   tricky stuff   the occupational licensing will not help workers as the minimum wage hike would  because there is  probably  greater rent exhaustion in the licensing case   the workers get higher wages  but they are paid the higher wages precisely to compensate them for and pull them through those arduous training programs so the licensing and the minimum wage hike are  not  equivalent  for that reason alone   but still  the licensing will not really  harm  the interests of the workers  again the burden being born by the employer  or possibly the consumers in the retail market to some extent so if you are finding occupational licensing results that damage overall worker welfare  you must not accept the premises of the low price elasticity demand for labor model another way to put the point is that the occupational licensing papers are testing some of the common presumptions of minimum wage models  and flunking them  first addendum   it is not an adequate reply to this post to reiterate  with multiple citations  that minimum wage hikes do not lower employment   even assuming that is true  other simple models will generate that result  without clashing with the occupational licensing studies   for instance  the employer might respond to the minimum wage hike by lowering the quality of some features of the job   in essence you are then suggesting the demand for labor may be elastic  but the real wage has not changed much in the first place  and then it is easy enough in the occupational licensing setting for the burden of licensing to fall on the class of workers as a whole  second addendum   there is a longer history of minimum wage assumptions not really being consistent with other economic views have you ever heard someone argue for wage subsidies  and  minimum wage hikes   no go   the demand for labor is either elastic or it is not have you ever heard someone argue for minimum wage hikes and inelastic labor demand  yet claim that immigrants do not lower wages   well  the latter claim about immigration implies  elastic  labor demand have you ever heard someone argue that  sticky wages  reduce employment in hard times but government imposed sticky minimum wages do not    it would seem we can now add to that list   maybe we will see a new view come along  labor demand is elastic when licensing restrictions are imposed  but labor demand is inelastic when minimum wages are imposed   third addendum   of course there are numerous other ways this analysis could run   what is striking to me is that people do not seem to undertake it at all ,['marginalrevolution.com'],61,2019-10-23 00:47:12

1133,0,2019-10-14 05:52:48,the nobel prize goes to    and   links to home pages  for field experiments in development economics  esther duflo was a john bates clark medal winner  a macarthur  genius  award winner  and is now the second woman to win the economics nobel and by far the youngest person to ever win the economics nobel  arrow was the previous youngest winner    duflo and banerjee are married so these are also the first spouses to win the economics nobel although not the first spouses to win nobel prizes there was even one member of a nobel prize winning spouse couple who won the nobel prize in economics  can you name the spouses michael kremer wrote two of my favorite papers ever  the first is  which you can find in my book   the idea of a patent buyout is for the government to buy a patent and rip it up  opening the idea to the public domain  how much should the government pay  to decide this they can hold an auction  anyone can bid in the auction but the winner receives the patent only say 10  of the time the other 90  of the time the patent is bought by the government at the market price  the value of this procedure is that 90  of the time we get all the incentive properties of the patent without any of the monopoly costs  thus  we eliminate the innovation tradeoff  indeed  the government can even top the market price up by say 15  in order to increase the incentive to innovate  you might think the patent buyout idea is unrealistic  but in fact  kremer went on to pioneer an important version of the idea  the  which was used to guarantee a market for the pneumococcal vaccine which has now been given to some 143 million children  bill gates was involved with governments in supporting the project my second kremer paper is   an economist examining one million years of the economy  i like to say that there are two views of humanity  people are stomachs or people are brains  in the people are stomachs view  more people means more eaters  more takers  less for everyone else  in the people are brains view  more people means more brains  more ideas  more for everyone else  the people are brains view is my view and paul romer is view  ideas are nonrivalrous   kremer tests the two views  he shows that over the long run economic growth  increased  with population growth  people are brains oh  and can i add a third kremer paper   is a great and deep paper    on the o ring model  the work for which the nobel was given is for field experiments in development economics  kremer began this area of research with randomized trials of   duflo and banerjee then deepened and broadened the use of field experiments and in 2003 established the  which has been the nexus for field experiments in development economics carried on by hundreds of researchers around the world much has been learned in field experiments about what does and also does not work  in   dufflo  hanna and ryan created a successful program to monitor and reduce teacher absenteeism in india  a problem that michael kremer had shown in  was very serious with some 30  of teachers not showing up on a typical day  but when they tried to institute a similar program for nurses in  the program was soon undermined by local politicians and  eighteen months after its inception  the program had become completely ineffective   similarly  banerjee  duflo  glennerster and kinnan find that   sorry fellow laureate    a frustrating lesson has been the context dependent nature of results and the difficult of finding external validity   lant pritchett in a critique of the  randomistas  argues that  rather than micro experiment  see also bill easterly on the success of the   duflo  kremer and robinson study   this is an especially interest piece of research because they find that rates of return are very high but that farmers do not use much fertilizer  why not  the reasons seem to have much more to do with behavioral biases than rationality  some interventions help our findings suggest that simple interventions that affect neither the cost of  nor the payoff to  fertilizer can substantially increase fertilizer use  in particular  offering farmers the option to buy fertilizer  at the full market price  but with free delivery  immediately after the harvest leads to an increase of at least 33 percent in the proportion of farmers using fertilizer  an effect comparable to that of a 50 percent reduction in the price of fertilizer  in contrast  there is no impact on fertilizer adoption of offering free delivery at the time fertilizer is actually needed for top dressing   this finding seems inconsistent with the idea that low adoption is due to low returns or credit constraints  and suggests there may be a role for non fully rational behavior in explaining production decisions this is reminiscent of people in developed countries who do not adjust their retirement savings rates to take advantage of employer matches   a connection to thaler is work  duflo and banerjee have conducted many of their field experiments in india and have looked at not just conventional questions of development economics but also at politics  in 1993  india introduced a constitutional rule that said that each state had to reserve a third of all positions as chair of village councils for women  in a series of papers  duflo studies this natural experiment which involved randomization of villages with women chairs  in   with chattopadhyay  she finds that female politicians change the allocation of resources towards infrastructure of relevance to women  in   beaman et al   she finds that having once had a female village leader increases the prospects of future female leaders  i e  exposure reduces bias before banerjee became a randomistas he was a theorist  his  is also a favorite  the essence of the model can be explained in a simple example  from the paper   suppose there are two restaurants a and b  the prior probability is that a is slightly more likely to be a better restaurant than b but in fact b is the better restaurant  people arrive at the restaurants in sequence and as they do they get a signal of which restaurant is better and they also see what choice the person in front of them made  suppose the first person in line gets a signal that the better restaurant is a  contrary to fact   they choose a  the second person then gets a signal that the better restaurant is b  the second person in line also sees that the first person chose a  so they now know one signal is for a and one is for b and the prior is a so the weight of the evidence is for a the second person also chooses restaurant a  the next person in line also gets the b signal but for the same reasons they also choose a  in fact  everyone chooses a even if 99 out of 100 signals are b  we get a herd  the sequential information structure means that the information is wasted  thus  how information is distributed can make a huge difference to what happens  a lot of lessons here for tweeting and facebook banerjee is also the author of some original and key pieces on indian economic history  most notably   with iyer    previous      on mr before last year is nobel announcement tyler wrote i have never once gotten it right  at least not for exact timing  so my apologies to anyone i pick  sorry bill baumol    nonetheless this year i am

1155,1,2019-10-09 10:33:32,truly an excellent episode  ben is an author and journalist   here is   covering most of all the opioid epidemic and rap music  but not only here is one excerpt  cowen   but if   and you can just send it through the mail  why does not it spread automatically wherever it is going to go  is it some kind of recommender network  it would not seem that it is a supply constraint  it is more like someone told you about a restaurant they ate at last night  westhoff   it is because the mexican cartels are still really strongly in the trade  even though it is all made in china  much of it is trafficked through the cartels  who buy the precursors  the fentanyl ingredients  from china  make it the rest of the way  then they send it through the border into the us you  can  get fentanyl in the mail from china  and many people do  it comes right to your door through the us postal service  but it takes a certain level of sophistication with the drug dealers to pull that off  cowen   it is such a big life decision  and it is shaped by this very small cost of getting a package from new hampshire to florida  what should we infer about human nature as a result of that  what is your model of the human beings doing this stuff if those geographic differences really make the difference for whether or not you do this and destroy your life  westhoff   well  everything is local  right  not just politics  you are influenced by the people around you and the relative costs  in st  louis  it is so incredibly cheap  like  5 to get some heroin  some fentanyl  i do not know how it works in  say  new hampshire  but i know in places like west virginia  it is still a primarily  pill  market  people do not use powdered heroin  for example  for whatever reason  they prefer oxycontin  so that has affected the market  too and  cowen   did  do the right thing  legalizing so many synthetic drugs in 2013  westhoff   i absolutely think they did  it was an unprecedented thing  now drugs like marijuana  cocaine  heroin  all the drugs you have heard of  are internationally banned  but what new zealand did was it legalized these forms of synthetic marijuana  so synthetic marijuana has a really bad reputation  it goes by names like k2 and spice  and it is big in homeless populations  it is causing huge problems in places like dc but if you make synthetic marijuana right  as this character in my book named matt bowden was doing in new zealand  you can actually make it so it is less toxic  so it is somewhat safe  that is what he did  they legalized these safer forms of it  and the overdose rate plummeted  very shortly thereafter  however  they banned them again  and now   cowen   and what about  and slovenia   their experiments in decriminalization  how have those gone  westhoff   by all accounts  they have been massive successes  portugal had this  huge  problem with heroin  talking like one out of every 100 members of the population was touched by it  or something like that  and now those rates have gone way down in slovenia  they have no fentanyl problem  they barely have an opioid problem  their rates of aids and other diseases passed through needles have gone way down and on rap music  cowen   this question is maybe a little difficult to explain  but wherein lies the musical talent of hip hop  if we look at mozart  there is melody  there is harmony  if you listen to stravinsky is  rite of spring   it is something very specifically rhythmic  and the textures  and the organization of the blocks of sound  the poetry aside  what is it musically that accounts for the talent in rap music  westhoff   first of all  riding a beat  rapping  if you will  is extremely hard  and anyone who is ever tried to do it will tell you  you have to have the right cadence  you have to have the right breath control  and it is a talent  there is also   this might sound trivial  but picking the right music to rap over so hip hop  of course  is a genre that is made up of other genres  in the beginning  it was disco records that people used  and then jazz  and then on and on  rock records have been rapped over  even  but what song are you going to pick to use  and if someone has a good ear for a sound that goes with their style  that is something you cannot teach and yes on overrated vs  underrated  you get taylor swift  clint eastwood  and seinfeld  among others   i highly recommend   but most of all his latest one  ,"['medium.com', 'scmp.com', 'drugpolicy.org', 'theguardian.com', 'marginalrevolution.com', 'amazon.com', 'amazon.com']",25,2019-10-09 11:45:42

1225,1,2019-09-25 00:36:52,as you might expect  it is coming from chang tsai hsieh and esteban rossi hansberg  here is their abstract the rise in national industry concentration in the us between 1977 and 2013 is driven by a new industrial revolution in three broad non traded sectors  services  retail  and wholesale  sectors where national concentration is rising have increased their share of employment  and the expansion is entirely driven by the number of local markets served by firms  firm employment per market has either increased slightly at the msa level  or decreased substantially at the county or establishment levels  in industries with increasing concentration  the expansion into more markets is more pronounced for the top 10  firms  but is present for the bottom 90  as well  these trends have not been accompanied by economy wide concentration  top u s  firms are increasingly specialized in sectors with rising industry concentration  but their aggregate employment share has remained roughly stable  we argue that these facts are consistent with the availability of a new set of fixed cost technologies that enable adopters to produce at lower marginal costs in all markets  we present a simple model of firm size and market entry to describe the menu of new technologies and trace its implications this is likely to prove one of the most important papers of the year  here is    the authors open with the example of the cheesecake factory  and also health care the standardization of production over a large number of establishments that has taken place in sit down restaurant meals due to companies such as the cheesecake factory has taken place in many non traded sectors  take hospitals as another example  four decades ago  about 85  of hospitals were single establishment non profits  today  more than 60  of hospitals are owned by forprofit chains or are part of a large network of hospitals owned by an academic institution  such as the university of chicago hospitals  and  rising concentration in these sectors is entirely driven by an increase the number of local markets served by the top firms here is a key point  we find that total employment rises substantially in industries with rising concentration  this is true even when we look at total employment of the smaller firms in these industries  this evidence is consistent with our view that increasing concentration is driven by new ict enabled technologies that ultimately raise aggregate industry tfp  it is not consistent with the view that concentration is due to declining competition or entry barriers  as suggested by gutierrez and philippon  2017  and furman and orszag  2018   as these forces will result in a decline in industry employment this is interesting too  and it departs from say what amazon is doing  we show that the top firms in the economy as a whole have become increasingly specialized in narrow set of sectors  and these are precisely the non traded sectors that have undergone an industrial revolution  at the same time  top firms have exited many sectors  the net effect is that there is essentially no change in concentration by the top firms in the economy as a whole  the  super star  firms of today is economy are larger in their chosen sectors and have unleashed productivity growth in these sectors  but they are not any larger as a share of the aggregate economy the paper is titled   ,"['faculty.chicagobooth.edu', 'faculty.chicagobooth.edu']",39,2019-09-25 00:59:45

if they were toys on a nightmarish baby mobile  it is an amazing and horrifying display not unlike christian devotees in the philippines who are  but what are the effects of these practices on those who undergo them  surprisingly  positive  in     a group of anthropologists  biologists and religious studies scholars compared measures of physiological  psychological and social well being in a small group of devotees compared to a matched sample  the group performing the ritual had no long lasting health harms but did appear to benefit psychologically through feelings of euphoria and greater self regard and socially through higher status despite their potential risks    in many contexts are paradoxically associated with health and healing  jilek   ward    our findings suggest that within those contexts  such  may indeed convey certain psychological benefits to their performers  our physiological measurements show that the kavadi is very stressful and high in energetic demands     but the ostensibly dangerous ordeal had no detectable persistent harmful  on participants  who in fact showed signs of improvement in their perceived health and quality of life  we suggest that the  of  participation on psychological  being occur through two distinct but mutually compatible pathways  a bottom up process triggered by neurological responses to the ordeal and a top down process that relies on communicative elements of  performance  hobson et al    specifically  the bottom up pathway involves physical aspects of  performance related to emotional regulation   is a common behavioral response to stress  lang et al    sosis    and anthropological evidence shows that in many cultures dysphoric  involving intense and prolonged exertion and or altered states of consciousness are considered as efficient ways of dealing with various illnesses  jilek    in our study  those who suffered from chronic illnesses engaged in more painful forms of participation by enduring more piercings  notably  higher levels of pain during the  were associated with improvements in self assessed health post   although the pain was relatively short lived  there is evidence that the social and individual  of participation can be long lasting  tewari et al    whitehouse and lanman   the sensory  physiological  and emotional hyperarousal involved in strenuous ordeals can produce feelings of euphoria and alleviation from pain and anxiety  fischer et al    xygalatas    and there is evidence of a neurochemical basis for these  via endocrine alterations in neurotransmitters such as endorphins  boecker et al    lang et al    or endocannabinoids  fuss et al     these endocrine  are amplified when performed collectively  as shown by studies of communal chanting  dancing  and other common aspects of   tarr et al     while it is uncertain how long lasting these  are  such euphoric experiences may become self referential for future  being assessment at the same time  a top down pathway involves social symbolic aspects of   cultural expectations and beliefs in the healing power of the  may act as a placebo  mcclenon    buffering stress induced pressures on the immune system  rabin    in addition  social factors can interact with and amplify the low level  of physiological arousal  konvalinka et al     performed collectively  these  can provide additional comfort through forging communal bonds  providing a sense of community and belonging  and building social networks of support  dunbar and shultz   xygalatas et al     the thaipusam is the most important collective event in the life of this community  and higher investments in this  are ostensibly perceived by other members as signs of allegiance to the group  consequently enhancing participants  reputation  watson jones and legare   and elevating their social status  bulbulia   power    multiple lines of research suggest that individuals are strongly motivated to engage in status seeking efforts  cheng  tracy  and henrich   willard and legare   and that there is a strong positive relationship between social rank and subjective  being  anderson et al    barkow et al     indeed  we found that individuals of lower socioeconomic status were more motivated to invest in the painful activities that can function as costly signals of commitment  recent evidence from a field study in india shows that those who partake in these  indeed reap the cooperative benefits that result from increased status  power   in addition  the cost of participation can have important self signaling functions  on the one hand  it can boost performers  perceived fitness and self esteem  which positively affects mental health  barkow et al     on the other hand  through a process of effort justification  such costs can strengthen one is attachment to the group and sense of belonging  festinger   sosis    this role of costly  in generating positive subjective states  bastian et al    fischer et al    wood

1345,0,2019-08-29 07:25:12," passed away suddenly yesterday  he was on many people is shortlist for the nobel  his work is marked by high theory applied to practical problems  the theory is always worked out in great generality and is difficult even for most economists  weitzman wanted to be understood by more than a handful of theorists  however  and so he also went to great lengths to look for special cases or revealing metaphors  thus  the typical weitzman paper has a dense middle section of math but an introduction and conclusion of sparkling prose that can be understood and appreciated by anyone for its insights  illustrates the model and is my favorite weitzman paper  it has great sentences like these noah knows that a flood is coming  there are n existing species libraries  indexed i   1  2     n  using the same notation as before  the set of all n species libraries is denoted s  an ark is available to help save some species libraries  in a world of unlimited resources  the entire set s might be saved  unfortunately  noah is ark has a limited capacity of b  in the bible  b is given as 300 x 50 x 30   450 000 cubits  more generally  b stands for the total size of the budget available for biodiversity preservation  if species library i is boarded on the ark  and thereby afforded some protection  its survival probability is enhanced to pi  essentially  boarding on the ark is a metaphor for investing in a conservation project  like habitat protection  that improves survivability of a particular species library  a particularly grim version of the noah is ark problem would make the choice a matter of life or death  meaning that pi  0 and pi  1  this specification is perhaps closest to the old testament version  so i am taking literary license here by extending the metaphor to less stark alternatives weitzman first shows that the solution to this problem has a surprising property the solution of the noah is ark problem is always  extreme  in the following sense in an optimal policy  the entire budget is spent on a favored subset of species libraries that is afforded maximal protection  the less favored complementary subset is sacrificed to a level of minimal protection in order to free up to the extreme all possible scarce budget dollars to go into protecting the favored few weitzman offers a stark example  suppose there are two species with probabilities of survival of  99 and  01  for the same cost  we can raise the probability of either surviving by  01  what should we do we should save the first species and let the other one take its chances  the intuition comes from thinking about the species or libraries as having some unique features but also sharing some genes or books  when you invest in the first species you are saving the unique genes associated with that species  and  you are also increasing the probability of saving the genes that are shared by the two species  but when you put your investment in the second species you are essentially only increasing the probability of saving the unique aspects of species 2 because the shared aspects are likely saved anyway  thus  on the margin you get less by investing in species 2 than by investing in species 1 even though it seems like you are saving the species that is likely to be saved anyway the math establishing the result is complex and  of course  there are caveats such as linearity assumptions which might reverse the example in a particular case but the thrust of the result is always operating   putting all your eggs in one basket is a good idea when it comes to saving species  weitzman gets the math details right  of course   but he knows that noah is not a math geek noah is a practical outdoors man  he needs robustness and rugged performance  in the field   as he stands at the door of the ark  noah desires to use a simple priority ranking list from which he can check off one species at a time for boarding  noah wishes to have a robust rule  can we help noah  is the concept of an ordinal ranking system sensible  can there exist such a simple myopic boarding rule  which correctly prioritizes each species independent of the budget size  and if so  what is the actual formula that determines noah is ranking list for achieving an optimal ark full of species so working the problem further  weitzman shows that there is a relatively simple rule which is optimal to second order  namely  
where r is an index of priority  higher r gets you on the ark  lower r bars entrance  d is a measure of a species distinctiveness this could be measured  for example  by the nearest common ancestor metric  u is a measure of the special utility of a species beyond its diversity  pandas are cute  goats are useful etc   c is the cost of a project to increase the probability of survival and delta p is the increase in the probability of survival so delta p c is the cost of increasing the probability of survival per dollar  put simply we should invest our dollars where they have the most survival probability per dollar multiplied by a factor taking into account diversity and utility the rule is simple and sensible and and it has been   much more could be done  however  to optimize dollars spent on conservation and weitzman is rule gives us the necessary practical guidance  rip ","['scholar.harvard.edu', 'jstor.org', '2378nh2nfow32gm3mb25krmuyy-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com', 'onlinelibrary.wiley.com']",48,2019-08-29 07:40:37

1400,0,2019-08-17 07:23:20,the graph at right made the  a few days ago  1 3k rts and 2 7k likes for noah   the graph looked off to me immediately  between approximately 1992 and 1994 the number of administrators went up by a factor of 4   or  if something goes from a 500  growth since 1970 to a 2000  growth rate since 1970  is that a factor of 3  confusing  anyway  a big jump   big jumps are often a sign that definitions  not reality  have changed  indeed  what is an administrator there is another problem with this type of graph which shows not absolute numbers but percent growth since 1970  everything in this graph depends on getting one number  the number of administrators in 1970  exactly correct  but the first number is the one that is the farthest in the past  often the hardest to find and the most suspect  but if that first number is underestimated then  every other number  in the chart is overestimated people send me this kind of thing all the time   see   they say    is wrong  it is not baumol   and i am always reluctant to follow up because tracking down the underlying data  figuring out what it means  if there are mistakes etc  is a huge time sink  it was the excellent  who go the ball rolling on the latest iteration of this graph  however  and he cites the graph to noted health economist uwe reinhardt is last book   so i thought it could be worthwhile to go deeper unfortunately  reinhardt simply calls this a  famous graph  and it is clear that he just found it on the internet like everyone else  oh dear  following up further  i did find the original  written in 1991 and taking the data up to 1987  wh cite the   you can find the sa 109th edition  but it does not have the data  at least  i could not find it  ok  several hours wasted finally  however  i did find a number for health administrators in an earlier edition of the sa  in the  in table 165  employed persons in selected health occupations  there is a number for  health administrators   which says 118 thousand in 1972  aha  now things are beginning to make sense because from that same table there were at least 3 5 million workers  physicians  nurses  technicians and others  in health occupations and 118 thousand administrators is clearly far too low  indeed  in a later paper  estimate that in 1969  18 2  of health care workers were in administration which would imply a figure of 639 thousand health administrators circa 1970  a much more plausible number the  piece also finds that between 1989 and 1994 the share of health care administrators as a percent of the health care workforce increased from 25 5  to  wait for it  25 7   in other words  no big jump and inconsistent with the huge jump seen in the graph it was at this point that i found kevin drum is   drum was also suspicious of the graph and after a lot of work he concludes that the graph exaggerates by at least a factor of 3 and probably more  drum estimates an increase in administrators of 831   using my initial number and drum is end number  i estimate an increase of 682   all numbers to be taken with a grain of salt  is that a big increase  compared to what  drum gives his best takeaway of the data as this graph  administration costs as a percent of health care costs  i agree with drum this way of presenting the data looks plausible  sensible and much less sensationalist than the original graph  note that there has been an increase in administrative costs  why  here is drum is bottom line bottom line  the health care system has grown tremendously over the past 50 years  but that is mostly not because we have a lot more doctors  it is because we have mri techs and ultrasound specialists and more kinds of nurses and more kinds of pills and enormous proton beams to cure cancer   those proton beams are massively expensive and require large staffs  but that does not mean you need any more oncologists per patient   to manage all this new stuff  we need bigger admin and support staffs  as a result  admin and support have grown about 50 100 percent on a relative basis  that is the real number i believe the original graph uses a number for administrators that is too low in 1970 and includes what i suspect was a change in definitions around 1992  project the 1970 to 1990 line forward or the 1994 to 2009 line backward and you will get a more accurate graph   more generally  the graph is misleading because it suggests that  administrators  are to blame for high health care costs and if only we could focus on the  real producers  of medicine  the physicians  costs would be much lower  blaming administrators for high prices is a lot like blaming  the middlemen   it is easy to say and easy to tweet but blaming the middlemen reflects a naive perspective on how goods and services are actually produced in a modern economy administrative costs in the united states are high compared to other countries like canada   helland and i discuss this in    we might even be able to lower administrative costs by moving to a single payer  universal system  but there is no free lunch and there is no returning to an administrative free eden ,"['milkenreview.org', 'twitter.com',

1436,1,2019-08-09 00:50:48,i have been following a bunch of twitter discussions around this topic  but i would like a firm estimate   if only your guesstimate   how much more german spending on infrastructure would boost general rates of return   one side question is whether such a policy might drag germany out of its  there is  i think  general agreement on a few magnitudes  noting that the moving averages may be more relevant than last year is numbers government consumption in germany is modestly below 20  of gdp total government spending in germany is modestly below 50  of gdp germany could and should spend another 1  or 2  more of gdp boosting its infrastructure the current german unemployment rate is about 3  germany runs large trade surpluses  relative to gdp  so the aggregate demand shortfall there cannot be biting  too hard  it would be good for the eurozone as a whole if the ecb were to adopt a more expansionary monetary policy  at least under some conditions  so no need to reiterate that in the comments  ok  so here is the thought experiment  let us say germany spends 2  of gdp more a year on roads  better internet speed  upgrading airports   whatever is best   and they do this each year for  as long as it takes  as we approach the new steady state  how much higher is the private return on capital    and what is then the implied rate of return on fiscal policy  note that the higher taxes  even if you postpone them through debt  will involve some deadweight loss and output restrictions sooner or later and what is the chance that brings germany out of negative yield territory on its government securities inquiring minds wish to know  addendum   keep in mind that most government projects these days are not direct output  rather they are inputs toward selling or producing further private sector outputs   so you build a better road so more people can get to the store  and the journey of the supply trucks is easier too   that means when the private sector activity shows constant returns to scale  while the greater output will be desirable  the private rate of return on those activities will not be going up at all  not in the steady state   so a big chunk of the government spending  while it may boost consumer surplus  will not increase rates of return period according to   its p 8 source is official but i cannot verify  according to the author is calculations   the rate of return on private capital in germany in 2013 was slightly below four percent   but say you have a capital share of output at about fifty percent and a four percent yield on that   capital then is giving you an extra 2  a year of gdp  it would seem   say that by spending 2  of gdp on infrastructure you could  double  the rate of return on all that capital  which seems implausible to me i might add    you are then spending about 2  of gdp a year to get about 2  of gdp a year   i am sure those are not the correct  exact numbers but what is the better non question begging way to think about the problem  your best bet of course is to invoke project durability    say you spend 2  of gdp for seven years  germany is not so quick at building things   and you get infrastructure that lasts say twenty years before needing another upgrade   years 8 20 it is pure bonanza  except the higher taxes may be kicking in then    that is indeed why i think the spending is a good idea   but that is hardly  stimulus    it is much closer to  we forgo valuable output for a bunch of years and much later people are better off with better roads and yes long run growth is important  of course that explains why the current government is less than enthusiastic to do this  stimulus    the merkel government is not stupid  it simply has a limited time horizon  and it does not assume that demand side economics is a free lunch at three percent unemployment and by the way  that spending is not  over any time horizon  likely to actually double the private rate of return on capital along the way  how are the negative yields supposed to disappear   in year eight  when the net benefits finally kick in   reflected in the term structure now  for the arrival of year eight     really     in the meantime  the german economy is modestly poorer if you disagree  please show your work   no moralizing about austerity or surplus countries  please   show your work ,"['marginalrevolution.com', 'boeckler.de']",57,2019-08-09 01:12:27
